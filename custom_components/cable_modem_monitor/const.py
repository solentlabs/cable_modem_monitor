***REMOVED*** SSL/TLS Certificate Verification
***REMOVED*** Hardcoded to False for the following reasons:
***REMOVED*** 1. Consumer cable modems universally use self-signed certificates (no CA-signed certs)
***REMOVED*** 2. Modems operate on private LANs (192.168.x.x) where MITM attacks are a different threat model
***REMOVED*** 3. No known cable modem manufacturer provides valid CA-signed certificates
***REMOVED*** 4. Enabling verification would break 99%+ of installations with no security benefit
***REMOVED*** 5. Users on compromised LANs have larger security issues than modem HTTPS
***REMOVED***
***REMOVED*** Security Analysis: The risk of MITM attacks on local cable modem traffic is negligible compared to
***REMOVED*** the usability cost. If an attacker has access to the local network to perform MITM attacks, they
***REMOVED*** already have access to intercept unencrypted modem traffic and can compromise the network directly.
***REMOVED*** The self-signed certificate still provides encryption in transit on the LAN.
VERIFY_SSL = False

***REMOVED*** Modem detection cache fields
CONF_PARSER_NAME = "parser_name"  ***REMOVED*** Cached parser class name for quick lookup

CONF_WORKING_URL = "working_url"  ***REMOVED*** Last successful URL
CONF_LAST_DETECTION = "last_detection"  ***REMOVED*** Timestamp of last detection

DEFAULT_SCAN_INTERVAL = 600  ***REMOVED*** 10 minutes - balanced default for network monitoring
MIN_SCAN_INTERVAL = 60  ***REMOVED*** 1 minute - minimum to avoid device strain
MAX_SCAN_INTERVAL = 1800  ***REMOVED*** 30 minutes - maximum useful interval
