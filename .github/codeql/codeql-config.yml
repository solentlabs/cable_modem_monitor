name: "CodeQL Security Scanning Configuration"

# Exclude tools directory from CodeQL scanning
# Rationale: Tools are diagnostic scripts for local network cable modems that use
# self-signed certificates. Same security reasoning as documented in const.py:
# 1. Cable modems universally use self-signed certificates (no CA-signed option)
# 2. Target environment is private LANs (192.168.x.x, 10.0.x.x)
# 3. MITM risk acceptable in private network context
# 4. Self-signed cert still provides encryption in transit
# 5. These are diagnostic utilities, not production code

  # --- Security exclusions (intentional design decisions) ---
  - exclude:
      id: py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data
      # Rationale: Cable modem diagnostics intentionally log configuration
      # for troubleshooting. Data is local to Home Assistant instance.
  - exclude:
      id: py/clear-text-storage-sensitive-data
      # Rationale: Home Assistant handles credential encryption.
      # Integration uses HA's built-in secure storage.
  - exclude:
      id: py/insecure-ssl-config
      # Rationale: Cable modems use self-signed certificates on private LANs.
      # verify=False is required for connectivity checks in config_flow.py.
      # Security justification documented in code comments.
  - exclude:
      id: py/request-without-cert-validation
      # Rationale: Cable modems use self-signed certificates on private LANs (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x).
      # verify=False is required for connectivity checks and data fetching from cable modems.
      # This is acceptable because: (1) modems don't offer CA-signed certs, (2) private LAN only,
      # (3) MITM risk is acceptable in home network context, (4) encryption still provided.

  # --- False positive exclusions (CodeQL limitations) ---
  - exclude:
      id: py/empty-except
      # Intentional: har_sanitizer.py uses `except json.JSONDecodeError: pass` for
      # graceful degradation. If JSON parsing fails during sanitization, we skip it
      # and leave content as-is rather than crashing the sanitizer.
  - exclude:
      id: py/unreachable-statement
      # False positive: CodeQL doesn't understand pytest.raises() context manager.
      # Code after `with pytest.raises():` IS reachable - the context manager catches
      # the exception and continues execution. Standard pytest pattern.
  - exclude:
      id: py/import-and-import-from
      # False positive in test files: Tests intentionally use both `import X as module`
      # (to access internals like _PARSER_CACHE) and `from X import func` (for clean API).
      # This is a valid testing pattern for verifying module-level state.
  - exclude:
      id: py/unused-global-variable
      # False positive: CodeQL doesn't track `global` statement properly.
      # parsers/__init__.py declares `global _PARSER_CACHE` before assignment.
      # The variable IS used on subsequent function calls for caching.
  - exclude:
      id: py/commented-out-code
      # Handled via paths-ignore for parser_template.py (intentional examples).
      # Other instances are format documentation like "# cells[0] = Channel number"
      # which are column mappings, not dead code.

# Enable all security-related query metadata
# This ensures comprehensive coverage of CWE categories
