name: "CodeQL Security Scanning Configuration"

***REMOVED*** Exclude tools directory from CodeQL scanning
***REMOVED*** Rationale: Tools are diagnostic scripts for local network cable modems that use
***REMOVED*** self-signed certificates. Same security reasoning as documented in const.py:
***REMOVED*** 1. Cable modems universally use self-signed certificates (no CA-signed option)
***REMOVED*** 2. Target environment is private LANs (192.168.x.x, 10.0.x.x)
***REMOVED*** 3. MITM risk acceptable in private network context
***REMOVED*** 4. Self-signed cert still provides encryption in transit
***REMOVED*** 5. These are diagnostic utilities, not production code
paths-ignore:
  - "tools/**"
  - "scripts/**"
  - "docs/**"
  - "tests/parsers/**/fixtures/**"
  - "cable-modem-monitor-ql/**" ***REMOVED*** Exclude development/testing query directory

***REMOVED*** Custom queries are loaded via workflow queries parameter
***REMOVED*** See .github/workflows/codeql.yml line 43

***REMOVED*** Query filters to reduce false positives
query-filters:
  - exclude:
      id: py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data
      ***REMOVED*** Rationale: Cable modem diagnostics intentionally log configuration
      ***REMOVED*** for troubleshooting. Data is local to Home Assistant instance.
  - exclude:
      id: py/clear-text-storage-sensitive-data
      ***REMOVED*** Rationale: Home Assistant handles credential encryption.
      ***REMOVED*** Integration uses HA's built-in secure storage.
  - exclude:
      id: py/insecure-ssl-config
      ***REMOVED*** Rationale: Cable modems use self-signed certificates on private LANs.
      ***REMOVED*** verify=False is required for connectivity checks in config_flow.py.
      ***REMOVED*** Security justification documented in code comments.
  - exclude:
      id: py/request-without-cert-validation
      ***REMOVED*** Rationale: Cable modems use self-signed certificates on private LANs (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x).
      ***REMOVED*** verify=False is required for connectivity checks and data fetching from cable modems.
      ***REMOVED*** This is acceptable because: (1) modems don't offer CA-signed certs, (2) private LAN only,
      ***REMOVED*** (3) MITM risk is acceptable in home network context, (4) encryption still provided.

***REMOVED*** Enable all security-related query metadata
***REMOVED*** This ensures comprehensive coverage of CWE categories
