name: "CodeQL Security Scanning Configuration"

# Query filters to exclude specific security warnings for intentional design decisions
query-filters:
  # Exclude certificate validation warnings for tools directory
  # Rationale: Tools are diagnostic scripts for local network cable modems that use
  # self-signed certificates. Same security reasoning as documented in const.py:
  # 1. Cable modems universally use self-signed certificates (no CA-signed option)
  # 2. Target environment is private LANs (192.168.x.x, 10.0.x.x)
  # 3. MITM risk acceptable in private network context
  # 4. Self-signed cert still provides encryption in transit
  - exclude:
      id: py/request-without-cert-validation
      paths:
        - tools/**
