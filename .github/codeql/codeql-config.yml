name: "CodeQL Security Scanning Configuration"

# Exclude tools directory from CodeQL scanning
# Rationale: Tools are diagnostic scripts for local network cable modems that use
# self-signed certificates. Same security reasoning as documented in const.py:
# 1. Cable modems universally use self-signed certificates (no CA-signed option)
# 2. Target environment is private LANs (192.168.x.x, 10.0.x.x)
# 3. MITM risk acceptable in private network context
# 4. Self-signed cert still provides encryption in transit
# 5. These are diagnostic utilities, not production code

query-filters:
  - exclude:
      id: py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data
      # Rationale: Cable modem diagnostics intentionally log configuration
      # for troubleshooting. Data is local to Home Assistant instance.
  - exclude:
      id: py/clear-text-storage-sensitive-data
      # Rationale: Home Assistant handles credential encryption.
      # Integration uses HA's built-in secure storage.
  - exclude:
      id: py/insecure-ssl-config
      # Rationale: Cable modems use self-signed certificates on private LANs.
      # verify=False is required for connectivity checks in config_flow.py.
      # Security justification documented in code comments.
  - exclude:
      id: py/request-without-cert-validation
      # Rationale: Cable modems use self-signed certificates on private LANs (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x).
      # verify=False is required for connectivity checks and data fetching from cable modems.
      # This is acceptable because: (1) modems don't offer CA-signed certs, (2) private LAN only,
      # (3) MITM risk is acceptable in home network context, (4) encryption still provided.
