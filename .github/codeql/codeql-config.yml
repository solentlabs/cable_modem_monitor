name: "CodeQL Security Scanning Configuration"

# Exclude tools directory from CodeQL scanning
# Rationale: Tools are diagnostic scripts for local network cable modems that use
# self-signed certificates. Same security reasoning as documented in const.py:
# 1. Cable modems universally use self-signed certificates (no CA-signed option)
# 2. Target environment is private LANs (192.168.x.x, 10.0.x.x)
# 3. MITM risk acceptable in private network context
# 4. Self-signed cert still provides encryption in transit
# 5. These are diagnostic utilities, not production code
