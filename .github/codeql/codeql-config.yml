name: "CodeQL Security Scanning Configuration"

***REMOVED*** Exclude tools directory from CodeQL scanning
***REMOVED*** Rationale: Tools are diagnostic scripts for local network cable modems that use
***REMOVED*** self-signed certificates. Same security reasoning as documented in const.py:
***REMOVED*** 1. Cable modems universally use self-signed certificates (no CA-signed option)
***REMOVED*** 2. Target environment is private LANs (192.168.x.x, 10.0.x.x)
***REMOVED*** 3. MITM risk acceptable in private network context
***REMOVED*** 4. Self-signed cert still provides encryption in transit
***REMOVED*** 5. These are diagnostic utilities, not production code

***REMOVED*** Custom queries specific to this integration
queries:
  - name: Cable Modem Security Queries
    uses: ./.github/codeql/queries/cable-modem-security.qls

***REMOVED*** Query filters to reduce false positives
query-filters:
  - exclude:
      id: py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data
      ***REMOVED*** Rationale: Cable modem diagnostics intentionally log configuration
      ***REMOVED*** for troubleshooting. Data is local to Home Assistant instance.
  - exclude:
      id: py/clear-text-storage-sensitive-data
      ***REMOVED*** Rationale: Home Assistant handles credential encryption.
      ***REMOVED*** Integration uses HA's built-in secure storage.

***REMOVED*** Enable all security-related query metadata
***REMOVED*** This ensures comprehensive coverage of CWE categories
