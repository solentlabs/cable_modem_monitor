name: "CodeQL Security Scanning Configuration"

***REMOVED*** Exclude tools directory from CodeQL scanning
***REMOVED*** Rationale: Tools are diagnostic scripts for local network cable modems that use
***REMOVED*** self-signed certificates. Same security reasoning as documented in const.py:
***REMOVED*** 1. Cable modems universally use self-signed certificates (no CA-signed option)
***REMOVED*** 2. Target environment is private LANs (192.168.x.x, 10.0.x.x)
***REMOVED*** 3. MITM risk acceptable in private network context
***REMOVED*** 4. Self-signed cert still provides encryption in transit
***REMOVED*** 5. These are diagnostic utilities, not production code
