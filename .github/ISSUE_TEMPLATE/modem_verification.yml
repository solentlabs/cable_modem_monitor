        ## Thank you for helping verify modem support! 🎉

        If you successfully installed Cable Modem Monitor with a modem marked with an asterisk (*) during setup, please help verify it works!

        Your feedback helps other users with the same modem know it's reliable.

        ### How to Download Diagnostics (Recommended)

        Attaching a diagnostics file helps us verify the data structure:

        1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Cable Modem Monitor**
        2. Click your modem device
        3. Click **Download Diagnostics**
        4. Attach the file to this issue

        The diagnostics file includes your modem data but **automatically sanitizes** sensitive information (MAC addresses, serial numbers, IPs).

        ### What Happens Next?

        - A maintainer will review your report
        - If verified, your modem will be moved to "✅ Verified Working" in the README
        - The asterisk (*) will be removed in a future release
        - Other users will know this parser is reliable!
