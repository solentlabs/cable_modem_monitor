## Next Steps for HACS Submission

### 1. Home Assistant Brands (Recommended)

Submit your integration to [home-assistant/brands](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands) for official icon support:

1. Fork the brands repository
2. Create directory: `custom_integrations/cable_modem_monitor/`
3. Add the following files from `brands_submission/` directory:
   - `icon.png` (256x256px)
   - `icon@2x.png` (512x512px)
   - `logo.png` (512x512px)
4. Create PR to brands repository

**Files ready:** The `brands_submission/` directory contains properly sized icons.

### 2. Submit to HACS Default Repository

Once brands submission is complete (or if you want to proceed without it):

1. Go to [HACS/default](https://github.com/hacs/default)
2. Click "Fork" to create your fork
3. Add your repository to the appropriate category file:
   - File: `custom_components.json` or similar
   - Add entry:
   ```json
   {
     "cable_modem_monitor": {
       "name": "Cable Modem Monitor",
       "description": "Monitor cable modem signal quality, power levels, and error rates",
       "category": "integration"
     }
   }
   ```
4. Create a Pull Request with title: "Add cable_modem_monitor integration"
5. In PR description, explain:
   - What the integration does
   - What modems it supports
   - Link to documentation
   - That it follows all HACS requirements

### 3. Alternative: Use as Custom Repository (Immediate)

Users can add it immediately without waiting for HACS approval:

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click three dots menu → "Custom repositories"
3. Add: `https://github.com/kwschulz/cable_modem_monitor`
4. Category: "Integration"

Add this to your README in the installation section (already done).

## Validation

To validate HACS compatibility before submission:

```bash
# Install HACS validation tools
pip install homeassistant

# Run validation (if available)
hacs validate
```
