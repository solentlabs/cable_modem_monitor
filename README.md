## Development Setup

### Quick Start (2 options)

**Option 1: Local Python (Fastest)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kwschulz/cable_modem_monitor.git
cd cable_modem_monitor
./scripts/setup.sh    # Installs dependencies in .venv
code .                # Opens in VS Code - that's it!
```

**Option 2: Dev Container (Zero setup)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kwschulz/cable_modem_monitor.git
cd cable_modem_monitor
code .                # Opens in VS Code
# Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted (wait 2-3 min first time)
```

**Both work identically** - choose based on preference. See [Getting Started Guide](./docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed comparison and troubleshooting.

### After Opening in VS Code

#### What You'll See

**Notifications:**

| Notification | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| "Dev Container configuration available..." | **Option A:** Click "Reopen in Container" (no setup needed)<br>**Option B:** Dismiss and use local Python |
| "Install recommended extensions?" | Click **"Install"** (Python, Ruff, Black, YAML) |
| "GitLens" or "CodeQL" | **Optional** - dismiss if you don't need them |

**Terminal Window:**
- If `.venv` doesn't exist yet, you'll see friendly setup instructions
- Run `bash scripts/setup.sh` to set up (takes ~2 minutes)
- After setup, close and reopen the terminal - it will auto-activate `.venv`

Then validate everything works:
```bash
# In terminal OR use VS Code task (Ctrl+Shift+P → Tasks → Quick Validation)
make validate
```

**Having issues?** See [Getting Started Guide](./docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed troubleshooting.

**Testing fresh developer experience?** Run `python scripts/dev/fresh_start.py` to reset VS Code state.

## How to Help Add Support for Your Modem

If your modem isn't fully supported or you'd like to help expand compatibility:

### Easy Way: Built-in Diagnostics (Recommended)

1. **Install the integration** with your modem's IP address
2. **Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Cable Modem Monitor**
3. **Click the device**, then **Download Diagnostics**
4. **Open a GitHub Issue** with your modem model and attach the diagnostics file

The diagnostics file automatically captures all the HTML pages we need to build a parser for your modem!

### Advanced Way: HAR Capture (Best for Authentication Issues)

**⭐ Recommended for authentication/login problems** (HNAP, form-based auth, etc.)

HAR (HTTP Archive) files capture the **complete HTTP conversation** with your modem, including:
- Full authentication flow (login sequence, cookies, headers)
- Session management and redirects
- All requests and responses

This is **much more useful** than HTML alone when debugging authentication issues.

**Two Methods:**

1. **Automated Script (Easiest)** - One command, fully automated:
   ```bash
   pip install playwright
   playwright install chromium
   python scripts/capture_modem.py
   ```

2. **Browser DevTools (Manual)** - Use your browser's Network tab to save HAR

**📖 See the [HAR Capture Guide](./docs/HAR_CAPTURE_GUIDE.md)** for complete step-by-step instructions with screenshots.

**Privacy:** HAR files are automatically sanitized to remove passwords and sensitive data before sharing.

**When to use HAR:**
- ✅ Your modem requires login and authentication isn't working
- ✅ HNAP-based modems (Motorola MB8600/MB8611, Arris S33)
- ✅ Form-based authentication issues
- ✅ Complex login flows with redirects

### Manual Way: HTML Capture (Simple Cases)

For modems with **no authentication** or when login works but parsing fails:

1. **Capture HTML Samples**: Provide us with the HTML source from your modem's status pages
   - See the [HTML Capture Guide](./docs/HTML_CAPTURE_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions
2. **Open a GitHub Issue**: Create an issue with your modem model and attach the captured HTML samples

**Your contribution helps everyone with the same modem model!**

**Want to develop the parser yourself?** This integration uses a plugin architecture that makes adding new models easy. See the [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to add support for your modem.

**Note**: This dashboard example includes all 24 downstream channels. If your modem has fewer channels (e.g., 16 or 8), simply remove the extra channel entries. If you have more channels, add them by following the same pattern with entity_ids like `sensor.cable_modem_ds_ch_X_power` where X is the channel number.

### Last Boot Time Display Options

The `sensor.cable_modem_last_boot_time` is a timestamp sensor. You can customize how it displays:

**Relative time (recommended)** - Compact and informative:
```yaml
- entity: sensor.cable_modem_last_boot_time
  format: relative
```
*Shows: "29 days ago"*

**Date only** - Just the date:
```yaml
- entity: sensor.cable_modem_last_boot_time
  format: date
```
*Shows: "2025-09-25"*

**Time only** - Just the time:
```yaml
- entity: sensor.cable_modem_last_boot_time
  format: time
```
*Shows: "00:38:00"*

**Full datetime (fits in UI)** - Date and time:
```yaml
- entity: sensor.cable_modem_last_boot_time
  format: datetime
```
*Shows: "2025-09-25 00:38:00"*

**Custom template** - For more control (may be too long for some UIs):
```yaml
type: markdown
content: >
  Last Reboot: {{
    as_timestamp(states('sensor.cable_modem_last_boot_time'))
    | timestamp_custom('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')
  }}
```
*Shows: "Last Reboot: 2025-09-25 00:38"*

## Troubleshooting

> **📖 For detailed troubleshooting help, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**
>
> Covers: entity ID cleanup, upstream sensors not appearing, duplicate entities, migration issues, and more.

### Integration doesn't appear
1. Check that files are in `/config/custom_components/cable_modem_monitor/`
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Check logs for errors: Settings → System → Logs

### "Cannot Connect" error
1. Verify modem IP address is correct
2. Open modem web interface in browser to confirm it's accessible
3. Ensure Home Assistant can reach the modem (same network)
4. If modem requires authentication, enter username and password in the config dialog

### Sensors show "Unknown" or no data
The modem's HTML format may differ from expected. To debug:
1. Enable debug logging in `configuration.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: warning
     logs:
       custom_components.cable_modem_monitor: debug
   ```
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Check logs for parsing errors
4. Open an issue with your modem model and a sample of the HTML

### Different modem page URL
Some modems use different URLs for signal data:
- `/cmSignalData.htm` (common Motorola)
- `/cmSignal.html`
- `/` (root page)

The integration tries multiple common URLs automatically.
