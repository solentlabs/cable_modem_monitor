- Use the appropriate issue template (bug report or feature request)
- Provide clear, detailed information
- Be patient and respectful

### 2. Pull Request Workflow

```
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes with tests
4. Run pre-commit hooks and tests locally
5. Update CHANGELOG.md
6. Submit a pull request
7. Respond to review feedback
8. Maintainer merges when approved
```

### 3. Review Process

- All pull requests require review by the maintainer
- Reviews should be completed within 2 weeks when possible
- Contributors should respond to feedback within 2 weeks
- PRs may be closed if inactive for 30+ days

### 4. Merging Requirements

Pull requests must meet these requirements before merging:

- [ ] All CI checks pass (tests, linting, type checking)
- [ ] Code coverage meets minimum threshold (60%)
- [ ] Changes are documented in CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional commits format
- [ ] Maintainer approval

## Release Process

### Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (x.X.0): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (x.x.X): Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Release Workflow

1. **Preparation**
   - Update version in `manifest.json`
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Create release commit

2. **Tagging**
   - Create annotated tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"`
   - Push tag: `git push origin vX.Y.Z`

3. **Automation**
   - GitHub Actions automatically creates the release
   - Release notes are extracted from CHANGELOG.md
   - Assets are attached automatically

4. **Announcement**
   - GitHub release is published
   - Users are notified via HACS

### Release Schedule

- **Patch releases**: As needed for bug fixes
- **Minor releases**: When new features are ready (typically monthly)
- **Major releases**: When breaking changes are necessary (rare)

## Decision Making Process

### Feature Acceptance

New features are evaluated based on:

1. **Alignment with project goals**: Does it help monitor cable modems?
2. **Maintenance burden**: Can it be reasonably maintained?
3. **User benefit**: Will it help a significant number of users?
4. **Code quality**: Is it well-tested and documented?
5. **Breaking changes**: Are they necessary and justified?

### Priority Levels

1. **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss bugs
2. **High**: Crashes, major functionality broken
3. **Medium**: Feature requests, enhancements
4. **Low**: Nice-to-have improvements, cosmetic changes

## Communication Channels

### GitHub Issues
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Technical discussions

### GitHub Discussions
- General questions
- Community support
- Ideas and proposals

### Pull Requests
- Code review
- Implementation discussion
- Technical decisions

## Code of Conduct Enforcement

The maintainer is responsible for enforcing the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Enforcement Process

1. **Warning**: First violation receives a private warning
2. **Temporary Ban**: Repeated violations result in temporary ban (30-90 days)
3. **Permanent Ban**: Serious or continued violations result in permanent ban

### Appeals

Appeals can be submitted to the maintainer via email. Decisions on appeals are final.

## Changes to Governance

This governance document may be updated by the maintainer as the project evolves. Major changes will be announced via GitHub release notes.

### Amendment Process

1. Propose changes via pull request
2. Allow 2 weeks for community feedback
