Choose your development environment:

Option 1: Local Python (Fastest)
  A. Use VS Code Menu: Ctrl+Shift+P -> Tasks -> 'Setup Local Python Environment'
  B. Or run from terminal: ./scripts/setup.sh (or .\scripts\setup.ps1 on Windows)
  - Takes ~2 minutes
  - Fastest test execution
  - After setup, close and reopen this terminal

Option 2: Dev Container (Zero Setup)
  A. Use VS Code Menu: Ctrl+Shift+P -> 'Dev Containers: Reopen in Container'
  B. VS Code may also show a pop-up notification suggesting this.
  - Takes ~5 minutes first time
  - All dependencies pre-installed
  - Guaranteed consistency with CI
