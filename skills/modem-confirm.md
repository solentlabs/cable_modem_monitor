# Modem Confirm

Read `packages/cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools/docs/MODEM_INTAKE_WORKFLOW.md`
Steps 13 through 16 in full before doing anything else. Execute each step
in order. Do not skip ahead.

Key requirements that are easy to miss:

- Strip exactly the keys listed in Step 13 — no more, no fewer.
- Channel arrays use compact rendering: one JSON object per line, no
  internal line breaks. All other objects use standard 2-space indent.
- Status flips to `confirmed`, not `verified` or any other value.
- Commit message follows the exact shape in Step 15, including the
  hardware summary line and `Related to #<issue>` (never `Fixes` or
  `Closes`).
- Show the user the files to stage; do not run `git add`.
