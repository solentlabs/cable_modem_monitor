"""Recovery — polling-cadence window around modem disruptions.

The modem is in *recovery* when it isn't operating normally and we
believe it may return. Recovery is a cadence concern only: it opens
a bounded window so consumers can switch to a faster poll rate, and
closes the window when the window duration expires. It does not
produce UX state, short-circuit polls, or publish a synthetic
"recovering" label — the snapshot stream always reflects modem
truth.

Three triggers enter the same window:

- ``restart()`` calls :py:meth:`Recovery.begin` after dispatching the
  reboot command.
- The orchestrator's connectivity policy engages on N consecutive
  poll failures — surfaced through :py:meth:`Recovery.evaluate_failure`.
- A 2-of-3 vote over (counter reset, uptime drop, transitional
  docsis) on a successful poll — see
  :py:meth:`Recovery._check_reboot_signals`.

See ORCHESTRATION_SPEC.md § Recovery for the full contract and
ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md § Recovery Architecture for rationale.
