"""Restart action — one-shot command dispatch.

``run_restart`` sends the reboot instruction, clears the collector
session, and triggers a recovery window. It does not wait for the
modem to come back, probe for liveness, or observe the reboot —
post-reboot polling cadence belongs to the recovery module.

See ORCHESTRATION_SPEC.md § Restart Action for the full contract.

    Procedure:

    1. Raise ``RestartNotSupportedError`` if ``actions.restart`` is
       None.
    2. Establish the monitoring session via ``collector.authenticate()``
       — unless ``actions.restart`` has ``action_auth`` set, in which
       case ``execute_action`` authenticates on a separate fresh session
       and the monitoring session is not needed for the restart command.
    3. Execute the restart action.
    4. Clear the collector session (forces fresh auth on the next
       poll — some firmware invalidates sessions after a reboot).
    5. Call ``recovery.begin("restart_command")`` so subsequent polls
       run at recovery cadence.
    6. Return a ``RestartResult``.

    Typical duration: 2–5 seconds. The caller does not block on the
    reboot itself. Any exception between steps 2 and 4 yields
    ``RestartResult(success=False, error="command_failed")`` — the
    only error token this function emits.
