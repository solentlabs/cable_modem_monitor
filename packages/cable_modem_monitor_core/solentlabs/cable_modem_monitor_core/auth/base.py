            — the loader skips re-fetching if the login response landed
            on a data page. Also set on failure (any branch where the
            modem returned a response) so the collector can render
            sanitized failure detail.
        response_url: URL path the login response corresponds to.
            May differ from the login URL if a redirect occurred.
        busy: The modem declined to serve the login without judging
            the credential, under a 2xx the status rule cannot read;
            each strategy's spec names the responses that mean it. The
            collector classifies it ``AUTH_UNAVAILABLE``, as it does a
            5xx (UC-87a). Only meaningful with ``success=False``.

    **Reuse contract — load-bearing.** ``response`` and ``response_url``
    advertise an auth-response-reuse opportunity to the loader, which
    decodes ``response.text`` as if it were a fetched data page. They
    MUST NOT be set when:

    - The login response body is an opaque artefact (e.g., a session
      token string returned for downstream URL injection).
    - The login response is otherwise not a parser-consumable data page
      for any path in the fetch list.

    Violating this contract causes the loader to surface the auth
    artefact as the data page and skip the real fetch — silently
    producing empty results. See RESOURCE_LOADING_SPEC.md § Auth
    Response Reuse and MODEM_YAML_SPEC.md § ``url_token``.
    Regression: SB8200 #81.

    On the failure path (``success=False``), ``response`` may be set
    so the collector can log sanitized wire detail; ``response_url``
    is irrelevant there because the loader is not invoked.
