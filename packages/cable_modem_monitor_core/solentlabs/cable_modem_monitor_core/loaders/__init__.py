"""Resource loaders — fetch data from modems.

HTTP loader for standard web interfaces, HNAP loader for SOAP,
CBN loader for Compal XML POST.

HNAP and CBN loaders are lazy-imported by the collector to avoid
pulling transport-specific dependencies (HMAC signing, defusedxml)
into every consumer of this package.

See RESOURCE_LOADING_SPEC.md.
