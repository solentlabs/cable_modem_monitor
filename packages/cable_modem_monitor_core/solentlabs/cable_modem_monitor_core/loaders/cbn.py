"""CBN (Compal Broadband Networks) XML POST resource loader.

Fetches data from Compal modem firmware via POST to a ``getter_endpoint``
with ``fun=N`` parameters. Each response is XML parsed with defusedxml.

Key constraints:
- Sequential execution — the server rotates ``sessionToken`` on every
  response, so requests must be serialized.
- Token must be the first POST body parameter.
- Logout is handled by the collector via ``actions.logout`` config,
  not by the loader (avoids double-logout).

A fetch failure is surfaced, never skipped: connection and timeout
errors propagate for the collector to read as ``CONNECTIVITY``, and a
non-2xx raises ``ResourceLoadError`` carrying its status. Only a body
that will not decode is skipped, which is the case that behaviour was
built for.

See RESOURCE_LOADING_SPEC.md CBN XML POST Loading section.
