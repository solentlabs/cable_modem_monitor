Intake / onboarding pipeline specs live in the
[Catalog Tools docs](../../cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools/docs/)
(carved out of Core in v3.14). Catalog Tools is the maintainer
authoring package — HA never installs it. See ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md
§ "catalog_tools is a developer accelerator, never a runtime dep".

## HA Integration Specs

| Document | Governs |
|----------|---------|
| [CONFIG_FLOW_SPEC.md](../../../custom_components/cable_modem_monitor/docs/CONFIG_FLOW_SPEC.md) | Setup wizard — steps, config entry, variant resolution |
| [ENTITY_MODEL_SPEC.md](../../../custom_components/cable_modem_monitor/docs/ENTITY_MODEL_SPEC.md) | Core output → HA entities, attributes, availability |
| [HA_ADAPTER_SPEC.md](../../../custom_components/cable_modem_monitor/docs/HA_ADAPTER_SPEC.md) | HA wiring — runtime data, coordinators, polling modes, restart, reauth |

## Conventions

Where content goes when adding or editing specs.

### Which document

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — how the system fits together: packages,
  boundaries, invariants, extension points.
- `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` — why it is that way: distilled
  decisions, their rationale, and what they constrain. Design detail
  links out to the spec that owns it.
- `*_SPEC.md` files — contracts the code must satisfy: signatures,
  schemas, rules. The test for spec text: it can be checked against
  the implementation.
- Runnable procedures a person executes step by step belong in
  workflow docs (e.g. the catalog tools intake workflow), which cite
  the governing spec rather than restating its rules.

### Own file vs a section

A topic earns its own file when it has its own conformance surface —
a protocol, format, or subsystem implemented or verified in isolation
(each auth strategy and parser format has one). Otherwise it is a
section in the doc that already governs the surrounding surface. A
new file always gets a row in the index above.

### Anti-bloat

- One home per rule. A fact stated in two docs will drift; state it
  once and link from everywhere else.
- Specs state the current contract only — no version history or
  "previously" narrative; git carries that.
- Quote code only as far as the contract requires (public signature,
  schema); implementation detail stays in code.
- A decision enters `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` only if it constrains
  future work; alternatives merely considered are omitted.

### Cross-linking

Cite as `FILE.md § Section Name` with a relative link. The doc that
owns a rule is the link target; consumers point to it with at most
one sentence of local context.
