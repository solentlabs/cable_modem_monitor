# Event Taxonomy

All log output from the orchestration layer flows through a single typed
event union. Components construct the appropriate event and pass it to
`log_event()` in `orchestration/logging.py`. The adapter owns level
routing and message formatting; components never call `_logger` directly.

Events are plain `@dataclass` types. The adapter dispatches via
`isinstance` — no discriminator field. Each event carries `level:
EventLevel` (see below) and `model: str` for multi-modem disambiguation.

## EventLevel

```python
class EventLevel(IntEnum):
    DEBUG   = logging.DEBUG    # 10
    INFO    = logging.INFO     # 20
    WARNING = logging.WARNING  # 30
    ERROR   = logging.ERROR    # 40
```

`IntEnum` — values are ints, passable directly to `_logger.log()`. No
mapping layer.

## Adapter contract

```python
# orchestration/logging.py
def log_event(logger: logging.Logger, event: OrchestratorEvent) -> None:
    ...
```

Single emission: one event, one log line, immediately. `OrchestratorEvent`
is the union type of all event dataclasses.

## Level policy

Most events carry a fixed level set as a dataclass default (`init=False`).
Events marked **caller-determined** take `level: EventLevel` as a required
init parameter — callers pass `EventLevel.DEBUG` for routine steady-state
operations and `EventLevel.INFO` for first-poll confirmation. This
preserves the first-poll-INFO / steady-state-DEBUG behaviour without
per-call-site level selection.

**Repeated findings warn once.** A finding that is not a failure, and
that recurs on every login while its cause stands, logs at WARNING the
first time the collector sees it and at DEBUG every time after, for the
collector's lifetime. "The same" means the same condition with the same
values; a changed value warns again. The diagnostics download carries
the current findings, so demoting the repeats loses nothing.
`LoginPageDriftDetected` follows this rule.

## Event inventory

### Phase: connectivity

| Event | Level | When |
|---|---|---|
| `ConnectivityFailureDetected` | WARNING | First failure in a connectivity streak; backoff set |
| `ConnectivityBackoffActive` | INFO | Subsequent poll skipped — still in backoff |
| `ConnectivityBackoffCleared` | INFO | Backoff counter reached zero; polling resumes |
| `ConnectivityBackoffReset` | INFO | User-triggered manual refresh cleared an active backoff |

Fields — `ConnectivityFailureDetected`: `model`, `streak: int`, `backoff_polls: int`
Fields — `ConnectivityBackoffActive`: `model`, `polls_remaining: int`
Fields — `ConnectivityBackoffCleared`: `model`
Fields — `ConnectivityBackoffReset`: `model`

### Phase: auth

| Event | Level | When |
|---|---|---|
| `AuthSucceeded` | caller-determined | Fresh login completed (never on session reuse — `SessionReused` covers that) |
| `AuthFailed` | WARNING | Auth failed |
| `AuthLockoutDetected` | WARNING | Lockout detected |
| `AuthCircuitBreakerOpen` | ERROR | Circuit breaker opened |
| `CircuitBreakerPollingBlocked` | ERROR | Per-poll guard — breaker is open; the remedy depends on what tripped it |
| `StaleSessionRecoveryDisabled` | INFO | Stale-session recovery streak hit threshold; session reuse disabled for this runtime |
| `LoginPageDriftDetected` | caller-determined | The pre-fetched `form` login page disagrees with the config (log only) |

Fields — `AuthSucceeded`: `model`, `strategy: str`, `status_code: int` (0 when
no response), `response_url: str` — the path the login response landed on,
`""` for strategies that advertise no reuse page. Form logins follow
redirects, so an accepted and a refused login can both end 200; the landing
path is what separates them. Rendered as `landed: <path>` only when set.

The collector emits `EventLevel.INFO` for the first login of its lifetime and
`EventLevel.DEBUG` for every login after it — the auth/resource tier in
ORCHESTRATION_SPEC.md § Logging Contract.
Fields — `AuthFailed`: `model`, `strategy: str`, `error: str`, `method: str | None`,
`url: str | None`, `status_code: int | None`, `content_type: str | None`,
`response_body: str | None`
Fields — `AuthLockoutDetected`: `model`, `streak: int`
Fields — `AuthCircuitBreakerOpen`: `model`, `streak: int`,
`status_code: int | None` — HTTP status of the failed login response
when the modem answered. A 404 renders the endpoint-not-found message
(wrong device at the address, or modem web interface unavailable)
instead of the credentials one; the stop behavior is identical either
way — retrying would keep posting credentials at an unknown device.
`signal: CollectorSignal | None` — which signal opened the breaker.
Fields — `CircuitBreakerPollingBlocked`: `model`,
`status_code: int | None`, `signal: CollectorSignal | None`

Both breaker events take their closing remedy sentence from
`auth_stop_advice()` rather than composing it locally. A trip cause
whose remedy is not "reconfigure credentials" — a firmware lockout, an
absent endpoint — is a row in that table, and every surface reporting a
stopped modem picks it up at once. Composing the remedy per event is
how the 404 wording came to exist on one of these two events and not
the other.
Fields — `StaleSessionRecoveryDisabled`: `model`, `streak: int`
Fields — `LoginPageDriftDetected`: `model`, `condition`, `configured: str`,
`observed: str`. `condition` is one of:

- `action_mismatch`: with `action_source: config`, the login form's
  `action`, resolved against the page URL, differs from
  `{base_url}{action}`. `configured` and `observed` are the two URLs
  with query values emptied and parameter names kept
  (`/goform/Login?id=`): a per-load token is one drift, not one per
  login, and no token reaches the log or diagnostics.
- `multiple_forms`: the page has more than one `<form>` and no
  `form_selector` matched one, so the first is read. `observed` is the
  form count.
- `selector_miss`: a declared `form_selector` matches nothing.
  `configured` is the selector, `observed` the form count.

The `form` strategy reports these on `AuthResult.login_page_drift`, on a
failed login as well as a successful one; the collector emits the event,
since `auth/` cannot import `orchestration/`. Nothing else reads the
findings: where the login posts and which form is read do not change.
Level: WARNING the first time, DEBUG after (§ Level policy). The latest
login's findings are `login_page_drift` in the diagnostics download.

Response-related fields on `AuthFailed` are `None` when auth failed with a
connection error (no HTTP response). That case renders as
`Connection failed during auth [MODEL] strategy=... — <error>` rather
than `Auth failed`: the modem judged no credential, so the remedy is
reachability, not a new password. `analysis/log_parser.py` matches this
line as `auth_fail`, so the two move together. Sanitization happens at event
construction time (not in the adapter) — the component knows the password
and strips the query string from `url` and scrubs the password from
`response_body` before creating the event.

### Phase: session

| Event | Level | When |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionReused` | DEBUG | Prior session reused |
| `SessionCleared` | DEBUG | Session cleared |
| `LogoutExecuted` | DEBUG | Logout action sent |
| `LogoutFailed` | WARNING | Logout action failed |
| `PostLoginFetchFailed` | WARNING | A `session.post_login_endpoints` path did not answer 2xx; collection continues |
| `HnapSessionExpired` | WARNING | HNAP HTTP error on a reused session — session likely expired |
| `JsonRpcSessionExpired` | WARNING | A JSON-RPC data call answered the entry's `session_expired_code` |
| `StubPageDetected` | WARNING | 0 of N expected parser anchors found — stub/login page served at data URL |

Fields — `LogoutFailed`: `model`, `reason: str`
Fields — `PostLoginFetchFailed`: `model`, `path: str`,
`status_code: int | None` (None on a transport error), `reason: str`
Fields — `HnapSessionExpired`: `model`, `status_code: int`
Fields — `JsonRpcSessionExpired`: `model`, `method: str`, `code: str`
Fields — `StubPageDetected`: `model`, `path: str`, `anchors_found: int`,
`anchors_expected: int`

| Event | Level | When |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionRetryStarted` | INFO | Single-poll session retry started for LOAD_AUTH or LOAD_INTEGRITY |
| `SessionRetrySucceeded` | INFO | Retry succeeded — fresh login obtained in same poll |
| `SessionRetryFailed` | INFO | Retry failed — policy recording signal as auth failure |

Fields — `SessionRetryStarted` / `SessionRetrySucceeded`: `model`, `signal_name: str`
Fields — `SessionRetryFailed`: `model`, `signal_name: str`, `streak: int`, `threshold: int`

### Phase: probe / health

| Event | Level | When |
|---|---|---|
| `HealthStatusReport` | internally-determined¹ | Health status derived from probes |
| `HealthRecoveryDetected` | INFO | Modem recovered from degraded state |

Individual probe failures (ICMP subprocess timeout, OS error, HTTP HEAD
failure) are direct `_logger.debug` calls — implementation detail
below the aggregate status signal. When probes fail consistently, the
status transitions to DEGRADED or UNRESPONSIVE and `HealthStatusReport`
fires at WARNING, which is the user-visible signal.

¹ `HealthStatusReport` computes its own level: WARNING on transition to
DEGRADED or UNRESPONSIVE, INFO on any other status change, DEBUG on
steady-state (no change).

Fields — `HealthStatusReport`: `model`, `status: str`, `changed: bool`,
`detail: str`
Fields — `HealthRecoveryDetected`: `model`, `previous_status: str`

| Event | Level | When |
|---|---|---|
| `HealthBackoffCleared` | INFO | Health probe confirmed modem reachable — connectivity backoff cleared |

Fields — `HealthBackoffCleared`: `model`

### Phase: collection / parsing

| Event | Level | When |
|---|---|---|
| `CollectionComplete` | caller-determined | Parse pipeline completed |
| `ParseError` | WARNING | Parser error on a resource |
| `ResourceLoadError` | WARNING | Resource could not be loaded |
| `HttpStatusError` | WARNING | HTTP 4xx/5xx on a resource |
| `ConnectionFailedDuringLoad` | WARNING | Connection dropped mid-load |
| `HnapConnectionFailed` | WARNING | HNAP connection failed |
| `HnapLoadError` | WARNING | HNAP load error |
| `ZeroChannelsNoSystemInfo` | WARNING | Zero channels and no system_info |

Fields — `CollectionComplete`: `model`, `ds_count: int`, `us_count: int`, `elapsed_ms: float`

The collector emits `EventLevel.INFO` for the first completed collection of
its lifetime and `EventLevel.DEBUG` for every collection after it — the
auth/resource tier in ORCHESTRATION_SPEC.md § Logging Contract. Pairs with
`AuthSucceeded`: the login line says the credential was accepted, this one
says the poll returned data.

Fields — `ParseError`: `model`, `reason: str`
Fields — `ResourceLoadError` / `HttpStatusError` / `ConnectionFailedDuringLoad`:
`model`, `path: str`, `status_code: int | None`, `reason: str`
Fields — `HttpStatusError` also carries `request_line: str`, `content_type: str`,
`response_body: str`, populated for 401/403 only and empty otherwise.
Fields — `HnapConnectionFailed` / `HnapLoadError`: `model`, `reason: str`

A 401/403 during load renders multi-line, mirroring `AuthFailed` — summary,
then `request:` (method, URL, and headers sent, with sensitive values masked
as `<set, len=N>`), `response:`, and `body:`. A bare status line cannot tell a
rejected session from a missing header or cookie. The collector constructs the
event because it is the only layer that knows the password: it scrubs
`response_body`, then truncates the result to the log-line budget.

**That order is load-bearing, not incidental.** Scrubbing replaces literal
occurrences of the password, so truncating first can cut the password across
the budget and leave a prefix the replace no longer matches — a fragment of
the user's password then ships in the log line. The same applies to
`AuthFailed`. Both are diagnostics contributors are asked to paste into
public issues, so the scrubbed text must be whole before anything trims it.

| Event | Level | When |
|---|---|---|
| `StatusTransition` | INFO | Connection status changed between polls |
| `CounterReset` | INFO | Error counters dropped — modem rebooted or stats cleared |
| `SystemInfoFieldsChanged` | WARNING | `system_info` field set changed between polls — possible firmware update |

Fields — `StatusTransition`: `model`, `from_status: str`, `to_status: str`
Fields — `CounterReset`: `model`, `prev_corrected: int`, `cur_corrected: int`, `prev_uncorrected: int`, `cur_uncorrected: int`
Fields — `SystemInfoFieldsChanged`: `model`, `gained: frozenset[str]`, `lost: frozenset[str]`

`SystemInfoFieldsChanged` compares parser-level fields only: the set is
taken after `docsis_status` is derived and before the orchestrator adds
the `rate_*` fields.

### Phase: restart / recovery

| Event | Level | When |
|---|---|---|
| `RestartCommandSent` | INFO | Restart command dispatched and session cleared |
| `RestartCommandFailed` | ERROR | Restart command failed |
| `RestartSessionRetry` | INFO | Restart refused on a reused session; clearing it and retrying once |
| `RecoveryWindowOpened` | INFO | Recovery window started |
| `RecoveryWindowClosed` | INFO | Recovery window ended |
| `RecoveryObserverException` | ERROR | Unhandled exception in recovery observer |

Fields — `RestartCommandSent`: `model`, `elapsed_seconds: float`
Fields — `RestartCommandFailed`: `model`, `reason: str`, `session_age_seconds: float | None`
Fields — `RestartSessionRetry`: `model`, `reason: str`, `session_age_seconds: float | None`

`RestartCommandFailed.session_age_seconds` — age of the monitoring session the
command went out on, measured from the login that created it (reuse does not
reset it). A refusal on a session held for hours reads differently from one on
a fresh login (#218). `None` when no monitoring session was used: the login
failed, or the action authenticates separately (`action_auth`).
Fields — `RecoveryWindowOpened`: `model`, `reason: str`, `window_seconds: float`
Fields — `RecoveryWindowClosed`: `model`, `elapsed_seconds: float`, `last_docsis_status: str`
Fields — `RecoveryObserverException`: `model`, `exc_type: str`

### Phase: actions (http exchange)

| Event | Level | When |
|---|---|---|
| `ActionStarted` | caller-determined | Action dispatched (HNAP / HTTP / CBN / JSON-RPC) |
| `ActionCompleted` | caller-determined | Response received, success path |
| `ActionConnectionLost` | caller-determined | Connection dropped — expected during restart |
| `ActionFailed` | WARNING | Bad response format, unexpected result, request error |
| `ActionPreFetchCompleted` | caller-determined | Pre-fetch returned data |
| `ActionPreFetchFailed` | WARNING | Pre-fetch connection error or bad response |

Fields — `ActionStarted` / `ActionCompleted` / `ActionConnectionLost`:
`model`, `transport: str` (`"hnap"` / `"http"` / `"cbn"` / `"json_rpc"`), `action_name: str`
Fields — `ActionCompleted`: adds `status_code: int | None`, `result: str`
Fields — `ActionFailed`: `model`, `transport: str`, `action_name: str`, `reason: str`
Fields — `ActionPreFetchFailed`: `model`, `transport: str`, `action_name: str`,
`reason: str`, `fallback_endpoint: str | None`
Fields — `ActionPreFetchCompleted`: `model`, `transport: str`,
`action_name: str`, `key_count: int | None`, `fallback_endpoint: str | None`,
`result: str | None`

`ActionPreFetchCompleted.result` — the HNAP firmware's `<Action>Result` value
(`OK`, `UN-AUTH`, ...) from the pre-fetch response. A key count cannot tell a
rejected pre-fetch from a good one. `None` when the response carries no such
key, and always for non-HNAP transports.

`ActionPreFetchFailed.fallback_endpoint` — non-`None` means extraction
failed but action continues with the static fallback endpoint.
`None` means the action is about to fail (`ActionFailed` follows).

### Phase: resource loading (http exchange)

| Event | Level | When |
|---|---|---|
| `ResourceFetched` | DEBUG | Data page fetched during collection |
| `ResourceDecodeError` | WARNING | Response could not be decoded |

Fields — `ResourceFetched`: `model`, `path: str`, `status_code: int`,
`size_bytes: int`, `elapsed_ms: float`
Fields — `ResourceDecodeError`: `model`, `path: str`, `fmt: str`, `reason: str`

`ResourceFetched` is emitted from `orchestration/collector.py` once per
page after `_load_resources()` succeeds. `ResourceDecodeError` is emitted
from `_load_http_resources()` and `_load_json_rpc_resources()` after the
loader's `fetch()` returns — the loader accumulates
`decode_errors: list[tuple[str, str, str]]` (path, fmt, reason) during
the fetch; the collector emits one event per entry. On `json_rpc` the
path is the method name and a JSON-RPC `error` names its code in
`reason`. Both sit in the collector rather than in `loaders/http.py` to
avoid a circular import.

The following loader calls remain as direct `_logger` calls: auth-response
reuse (DEBUG, low signal), login-page detection (fires immediately before
raising `LoginPageDetectedError` — the collection layer owns the signal),
and the unknown-format fallback warning in `_decode_response` (the loader
returns BeautifulSoup rather than failing, so no `ResourceDecodeError` is
appropriate).

## Intentional exceptions — direct `_logger` calls

The following calls bypass `log_event()` by design. Each has a documented
reason; adding an event type for them would not improve diagnostics.

| File | Message pattern | Reason |
|------|----------------|--------|
| `orchestration/orchestrator.py` | `"Session reuse disabled [%s]..."` (DEBUG) | Low-signal pre-poll detail. |
| `orchestration/orchestrator.py` | `"Poll [%s] — auth: %s, url: %s..."` (INFO/DEBUG) | Verbose first-poll context log. INFO on first poll, DEBUG after. No event needed — it summarises static config, not a runtime signal. |
| `orchestration/policy.py` | `"Unknown signal: %s"` (WARNING) | Defensive guard that should never fire. |
| `orchestration/collector.py` | `"No active session [%s] — Authenticating"` (DEBUG) | Pre-auth lifecycle noise. `SessionReused` fires on the reuse path; this fires on the non-reuse path as a single debug line. |
| `orchestration/actions/hnap_action.py` | `"Interpolated %s: ${%s} → ..."` (DEBUG ×2) | Variable interpolation detail for action payload construction. |
| `orchestration/modem_health.py` | ICMP/HTTP probe debug calls (DEBUG ×4) | Individual probe failures below the aggregate `HealthStatusReport` signal. Documented above in § probe/health. |

## Test pattern

Tests use a `capture_events()` fixture that intercepts events before
they reach `_logger`. Tests assert on the typed event, not on formatted
strings:

```python
with capture_events() as events:
    # ... trigger code ...
assert_event_emitted(events, AuthFailed, model="SB8200")
```

This decouples tests from adapter format choices. Wording changes in the
adapter do not break tests; substance changes (wrong event type, wrong
model, wrong level) do.
