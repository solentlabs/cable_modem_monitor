## Package Boundaries

### Three runtime packages with strict dependency direction

**Decision:** Core (engine) ← Catalog (content) ← HA Integration
(adapter), enforced through real Python packaging. A fourth package —
`catalog_tools` — provides catalog authoring tools; it is off
this runtime chain. See "catalog_tools is a developer accelerator"
below.

**Rationale:** Import violations are missing module errors, not lint
warnings. Core is platform-agnostic and could power any consumer —
HA, a CLI tool, a Prometheus exporter. Catalog is content-only (YAML
configs, parser overrides, HAR captures) with no business logic. The
HA integration is a thin adapter that maps Core output to HA platforms.

**Constrains:** Core cannot import from Catalog or HA. Catalog cannot
import from HA. No circular dependencies. Adding modem-specific
knowledge to Core is a design violation.

### Test harness lives in Core, not Catalog

**Decision:** Core owns the test harness (HAR replay framework, golden
file comparison, schema validators). Catalog contains only data files
(HAR captures, golden files).

**Rationale:** Catalog contributors cannot accidentally modify test
assertions or loader logic. Catalog's CI installs Core and runs Core's
test suite pointed at catalog files. Adding a modem never requires
writing test code.

**Constrains:** Test assertions cannot be customized per-modem.
Strategy changes are validated across all modems automatically.

### Test harness lives in Core, not catalog_tools

**Decision:** `core/test_harness/` (HARMockServer, auth simulators,
discovery, runner, golden-file comparison) stays in Core, despite the
fact that the standalone CLI it exposes (`python -m
…core.test_harness`) is contributor-onboarding tooling.

**Rationale:** Three packages consume the test harness — Core (for its
own auth and loader unit tests, where `HARMockServer` is the in-process
fixture), Catalog (for regression and golden-file pipelines), and
catalog_tools (for the contributor onboarding workflow). Of those,
only Core is upstream of the others. Moving the harness into
catalog_tools would force Core to depend on catalog_tools to run its
own tests, inverting the package dependency direction and breaking the
"catalog_tools is never a runtime dep" decision below (Core's tests
are part of what verifies that runtime).

**Note on prior confusion:** When `load_post_processor` (a runtime
extension-point loader, peer of `load_parser_config`) was discovered
imported by HA from `core.test_harness.runner`, it surfaced a real
misplacement — but only of that one function, not of test_harness as
a whole. The function was extracted to `core/post_processor.py`.
test_harness itself is correctly placed.

**Constrains:** The harness is part of Core's published surface, not a
separately-installable contributor tool. Test-harness coverage counts
toward Core's coverage gate. The standalone CLI (`__main__.py`)
remains in Core and is invoked via `python -m
solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_core.test_harness`.

### catalog_tools is a developer accelerator, never a runtime dep

**Decision:** The `cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools` package
contains the modem-onboarding pipeline — HAR analysis, YAML
generation, golden-file construction, verification ingest,
analyzer-correctness lints, fleet-pattern scanning, and trial
parsing. It is installed in development environments (maintainer
and contributor) and CI. It is never installed by HA or any other
runtime consumer.

**Rationale:** The system's minimum required surface is Core +
Catalog. Anyone could hand-author a valid `parser.yaml` and
`modem.yaml` and the integration would work end-to-end. Catalog tools
exist to reach a working configuration *faster and more consistently*,
not to make configuration possible. Every byte that ships to a user's
HA instance has install-size, dependency-closure, and security-
attack-surface cost; keeping intake tooling off that chain keeps those
costs tied only to runtime value.

**Operational test:** Deleting the `catalog_tools` package directory
must leave Core + Catalog + HA fully functional. If anything in
catalog_tools is structurally required by runtime code, that thing
is misplaced and must move into Core or Catalog.

**Constrains:** Nothing in Core, Catalog, or the HA integration may
import from `catalog_tools`. The HA integration's `manifest.json` does
not list `catalog_tools` as a requirement. `catalog_tools` depends on
Core and Catalog (one-way edge); neither ever depends on it.

### Catalog's runtime API surface is `CATALOG_PATH`

**Decision:** The only symbol the HA integration imports from
Catalog is `CATALOG_PATH` — a `Path` constant pointing at the modem
directory tree (`modems/{manufacturer}/{model}/`). Everything else
the integration needs, it gets from Core.

**Rationale:** Catalog is content-only. Its "API" is the structured
data at `CATALOG_PATH/{manufacturer}/{model}/*`, consumed by Core's
config loaders. A richer runtime API would pull per-modem logic into
Catalog, contradicting "Catalog has no business logic." Keeping the
runtime import surface at a single constant makes the rule
enforceable: if a runtime consumer needs to import anything else from
Catalog, the code belongs in Core instead.

**Constrains:** Helpers that operate on catalog YAML files at runtime
(config loading, cross-file validation) live in Core. Helpers that
operate on catalog YAML files at authoring time (fleet scanning,
trial parsing, normalization) live in `catalog_tools`. Catalog's
runtime package never grows a second top-level symbol without a
decision update.

### Pydantic is a Core runtime dep

**Decision:** `pydantic>=2.0` is declared in Core's
`[project] dependencies`, not gated behind an optional extra.

**Rationale:** Core's `models/` package defines `ModemConfig`,
`ParserConfig`, and `ModemData` as Pydantic `BaseModel` subclasses.
They are imported by runtime consumers —
`core/validation/cross_file.py`, `core/orchestration/*`,
`core/test_harness/runner.py`. A clean non-HA install of Core cannot
function without pydantic.

Prior to the v3.14 carve-out, pydantic was mis-declared as
`[project.optional-dependencies] mcp = ["pydantic>=2.0"]`. The bug
was masked in practice because Home Assistant itself depends on
pydantic and supplies it transitively. The carve-out corrects the
declaration.

**Constrains:** Anyone installing `solentlabs-cable-modem-monitor-core`
receives pydantic as a transitive install. The `[mcp]` optional
extra is removed; intake-pipeline heavy deps (ruamel.yaml and any
future additions) live in `cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools`.

---

## Core Schema Model

### Core's schema tracks fleet-observed metrics, not user analytics

**Decision:** Core ships data fields that are observed across the
fleet of cable modems, normalized into a vendor-neutral schema.
Derived fields are admitted when they re-present a fleet-observed
datum in a more directly useful form (e.g., cumulative FEC counters
exposed as per-minute rates) or fill in cardinality the fleet does
not always report natively (e.g., channel counts). User-side
analytics — spreads, deltas, composed health grades, threshold-based
classification — do not enter the Core schema. They belong in HA-side
blueprints distributed alongside the integration per
[BLUEPRINT_DISTRIBUTION_SPEC.md](../../../custom_components/cable_modem_monitor/docs/BLUEPRINT_DISTRIBUTION_SPEC.md).

**Rationale:** The catalog's authority comes from being a faithful
record of what cable modems actually report. That authority
underwrites two things: a defensible schema that contributors can
validate against real captures, and a descriptive document of fleet
behavior that could support standardization advocacy with the broader
cable-modem industry. The moment Core invents metrics no modem
exposes, the schema stops being documentation of the fleet and becomes
opinion — and loses both forms of authority.

This also resolves the recurring "where does derivation belong"
question without case-by-case judgment. The error-rate sensors
(`rate_corrected`, `rate_uncorrected`) are Core because they
re-present a fleet-observed datum (FEC codeword counters) over time;
the cumulative quantity exists on every DOCSIS modem. A signal-health
grade is HA-blueprint because no modem exposes a "health" metric and
the grade is composed from user-chosen thresholds. DS power spread,
max-of-N aggregates, weighted scores, and tier classification all
fall on the blueprint side for the same reason.

**Constrains:**

- A new Core field must be backed by evidence that the underlying
  metric is exposed across vendors. The catalog itself is the evidence
  base; `modem.verified.json` captures are the primary citations.
- Re-presenting a fleet datum (rate from cumulative count, canonical
  from non-canonical naming, count from list length) is admitted.
  Inventing a new aggregation no modem reports is not.
- Scoping decisions (e.g., SC-QAM-only error totals) must be
  defensible from how the fleet reports the underlying quantities,
  not from a downstream consumer's threshold preference. The FEC
  chain argument in PARSING_SPEC § Aggregate is an example of a
  fleet-observation justification.
- Interpretation, grading, and threshold-based classification live in
  HA blueprints, not in Core. PR proposals that require relaxing this
  rule (e.g., a signal-health sensor inside Core) are out of scope by
  this decision.

## Transport and Constraint Model

### Transport is a protocol identifier, not a constraint funnel

**Decision:** The `transport` field in modem.yaml identifies the wire
protocol: `http`, `hnap`, or `cbn`. For `http`, auth, session, and
format are configured independently (qualified — some auth/session
pairings are linked; see MODEM_YAML_SPEC.md auth-session-action
consistency rules). For `hnap` and `cbn`, the protocol constrains
everything.

**Rationale:** The majority of modems use HTTP requests regardless of
whether the response is HTML, JSON, or XML. The difference between an
HTML table scraper and a JSON API modem is response format, not transport.
Keeping transport separate from format means each does one thing:
transport selects the loader, format (in parser.yaml) selects the decode
step and extraction strategy. Auth strategies are orthogonal to both —
any auth can appear with any format over HTTP. HNAP and CBN are
genuinely different protocols (HNAP: SOAP POST + HMAC signing; CBN:
XML POST + AES-256-CBC), so each warrants its own transport value
where the protocol constrains auth, session, and format.

Evidence: across the HTTP modem population, no auth strategy is
structurally tied to a response format. Basic auth modems serve HTML
tables today, but nothing prevents a basic-auth modem from serving
JSON. The pairings observed are coincidental, not architectural.
See the HAR corpus analysis (local reference data) for the full
modem inventory and stress test results.

**Constrains:** Format strategies must be compatible with the value type
they receive. HTML formats expect `BeautifulSoup`, structured formats
expect `dict`. Misconfigured modem.yaml is rejected at load time.

### Capabilities are implicit from parser output

**Decision:** No `capabilities` field in modem.yaml. A mapping in
parser.yaml or an override in parser.py IS the capability declaration.
No mapping = no entity.

**Rationale:** Eliminates a separate capabilities list that drifts from
actual parser output. The parser output is the single source of truth.
Absent capability = absent entity — no greyed-out buttons, no "not
supported" placeholders.

**Constrains:** The only way to declare a capability is to implement
the extraction. The exception is `actions.restart` in modem.yaml, which
declares restart capability (a modem command, not parsed data).

---

## Auth Architecture

### Discrete strategies, not composable primitives

**Decision:** Auth is a discriminated union of self-contained strategy
types (`none`, `basic`, `form`, `form_nonce`, `url_token`, `hnap`,
`form_pbkdf2`, `form_sjcl`, `form_cbn`). Each strategy has a
per-strategy dataclass and a single audited implementation. The
alternative — a toolkit of composable primitives (encoding, CSRF,
nonce generation) that you mix and match per-modem — was rejected.

**Rationale:** The boundary between "separate strategy" and "config
flag" is structural behavior — how the auth protocol works. `form_nonce`
parses text prefixes, not redirects. `form_pbkdf2` requires multi-round
challenge-response with server salts. These are structurally different
protocols, not variations you can compose from shared building blocks.
Meanwhile, base64 encoding, CSRF tokens, dynamic endpoints, and
AJAX-style login are all config flags on `form` — same
POST-evaluate-redirect flow.

**Constrains:** Adding a new auth strategy requires a new dataclass
(with `display_name` and `transport` ClassVars), a new
`BaseAuthManager` subclass with a `create_manager()` entry point,
and a new entry in the `AuthConfig` union. The factory dynamically
imports the manager module by strategy literal — no factory code
changes, no isinstance chains, no manual registry updates. Display
labels and transport validation sets derive from the ClassVars
automatically. No per-modem auth hooks — all variation is modem.yaml
config.

### No per-modem auth hooks

**Decision:** Auth and session have no override points. All variation
is expressed through modem.yaml configuration.

**Rationale:** Auth touches credentials. One audited implementation per
strategy, not per-modem overrides that could mishandle passwords or
leak tokens. The variation across the modem fleet is wide but shallow —
different values (field names, encoding, cookie names), not different
behaviors. If a modem needs a genuinely new auth flow, that's a new
Core strategy.

**Constrains:** Cannot customize auth behavior per-modem. Any new auth
pattern requires a Core change — but this is intentional, as it
becomes available to all future modems using the same protocol.

### Session is lifecycle, auth owns the cookie

**Decision:** `cookie_name` and `token_prefix` live on the auth
strategy config, not the session section. Session config
(`headers`, `query_params`) is a separate top-level section that
owns post-login lifecycle — static request headers and logout timing.
`actions.logout` presence drives single-session semantics. Auth owns everything about the login flow
and its outputs, including which cookie the login response produces.

**Rationale:** The cookie is an output of the login flow — the modem's
`Set-Cookie` header in the login response establishes it. Auth managers
need the cookie name for protocol-level operations: `url_token`
clears stale cookies before re-login (matching the browser's
`eraseCookie()` call), and session validity checking asks "is this
auth cookie still present?" Placing `cookie_name` on session created
a cross-boundary dependency: the auth manager needed session config to
execute its own login flow, violating the separation it was designed
to enforce.

v3.12 and v3.13 stored `session_cookie_name` on the auth config
(`UrlTokenSessionConfig`). The v3.14 spec moved it to a separate
`session` section for cleaner YAML structure, but this broke
`url_token` pre-login cookie clearing and body token fallback — two
protocol behaviors that only surfaced during real-hardware testing
(SB8200, Issue #81). The move back restores the boundary that
v3.12/v3.13 got right: auth owns credentials and their artifacts,
session owns lifecycle.

Similarly, `token_prefix` is part of the `url_token` auth protocol —
the auth flow produces a body token, and `token_prefix` describes how
to inject it into subsequent requests. It belongs on `UrlTokenAuth`,
not session.

**Evidence:** Journal entries 2026-01-16 (resource-loader-architecture)
and 2026-01-27 (session-cookie-clearing-browser-behavior) document the
original discovery. The v3.14 gap analysis (2026-04-01) identified the
regression.

**Constrains:** No `logout_url` or `logout_required` convenience
fields. `actions.logout` presence drives single-session semantics;
`HttpAction.requires_session` controls whether the pre-retry logout
call is guarded by cookie presence. Auth strategies that don't use
cookies leave `cookie_name` empty (default).

### Session concurrency — SSOT via `actions.logout`

**Decision:** `actions.logout` presence is the single indicator that a modem
requires single-session discipline. `session.max_concurrent` (present in v3.13
and earlier) has been removed from `SessionConfig`.

**Rationale:** `max_concurrent: 1` and `actions.logout` always had to travel
together — one without the other was either dead config (logout without
`max_concurrent: 1` never fired) or a lockout footgun (`max_concurrent: 1`
without logout held the session open and blocked the user's web UI between
polls). Two fields encoding one constraint is redundant and a footgun source.
The XB10 onboarding gap made this concrete: the intake pipeline had configured
a logout block without `max_concurrent: 1`, silently disabling logout.

**New field:** `HttpAction.requires_session: bool = False` distinguishes
unauthenticated logout endpoints (`false` — can clear any active server-side
session without a cookie; safe to call during pre-retry recovery) from
session-scoped endpoints (`true` — skip the pre-retry call when Core has no
valid cookie, since it would fail anyway and the retry proceeds regardless).
CBN transport always embeds the session token by protocol; `requires_session`
is absent from `CbnAction` by type-system design.

**Fleet values (2026-06-10):** MB7621 GET `/logout.asp` and SB8200 basic GET
`/logout.html` — no cookie in HAR request → `requires_session: false`.
TG3442DE — logout present in YAML but no logout request captured in HAR →
`requires_session: true` (conservative; contributor verification open).

**Constrains:** Any modem with `actions.logout` configured is treated as
single-session. There is no mechanism to configure logout without triggering
single-session semantics.

### Auth-failure detail via single WARNING log

**Decision:** When the collector's auth phase fails, it emits one
sanitized ``WARNING`` log carrying the modem's response — strategy
name, request line, response status + Content-Type, and a short
body snippet with the user's password scrubbed. There is no
transport-layer adapter, no scoped capture, no separate entry
point, no structured ``AuthExchange`` type, and no
``har-capture`` dependency.

**Rationale:** The motivating issues (#86 Arris TG3442DE, #104
Netgear CM1100, #120 Technicolor CGA6444VF) are all stuck-setup
failures where a maintainer needs to see what the modem returned
to fix the catalog entry. The genuinely valuable signal for that
is the response status, Content-Type, and a body snippet — enough
to spot "this modem is HNAP, not form" or "the modem rejected our
field name". One log line covers it. An earlier v3.14 iteration
built a session-adapter capture mechanism with two entry points,
gating policy, structured exchange JSON in the diagnostics
download, and an upstream sanitization dependency — ~500 lines
plus a runtime dep, for marginal value over a single log line.
KISS prevailed.

The failure-detail log fires from the collector's existing auth
failure path, so initial setup, reauth, options-flow
re-validation, and steady-state polling all benefit equally
without per-flow plumbing. A circuit breaker bounds the volume
during steady-state failure.

**Constrains:** Auth managers must include the ``requests.Response``
on their failure ``AuthResult`` so the collector can render the
detail. The response body snippet is truncated to ~500 characters
and the user's literal password is replaced with ``[REDACTED]``;
URL query strings are stripped wholesale (some strategies put
credentials in the query — Arris ``url_token`` notably). Derived
credential forms (PBKDF2 hashes, SJCL/CBN encrypted blobs) are
left intact in the snippet — they are protocol-shaped, not the
user's secret, and they're often the diagnostic signal a
maintainer needs to confirm the strategy ran.

### LOAD_INTEGRITY failure detail via diagnostics download

**Decision:** When the collector's parse phase returns a
``LOAD_INTEGRITY`` signal (zero fulfilled anchors for an expected
resource), the stub response body is captured in
``OrchestratorDiagnostics.last_stub_body`` — a ``dict[str, str]``
keyed by resource path, value truncated to ≤500 characters. It
persists across successful polls until the next ``LOAD_INTEGRITY``
event.

**Rationale:** ``LOAD_INTEGRITY`` means the session expired and the
modem returned a JS redirect stub instead of channel data. This
failure is intermittent and self-healing — the recovery cycle clears
the session and re-auths, leaving no trace in steady-state. Bug
reports arrive as a diagnostics download (``diagnostics.json``
shared in a GitHub issue), not as live log snippets. A WARNING log
fires once and is gone by the time the user generates the download.
Placing the stub body in the structured download is the only path
that ensures the diagnostic artifact is present when the user shares
it.

This is intentionally different from the auth-failure detail
decision (which chose a WARNING log). Auth failures are observable
in real time by the user performing initial setup; they are
logged for that audience. ``LOAD_INTEGRITY`` failures occur in
steady-state polling and are recovered automatically — the user
who files a bug report may not know they happened. The diagnostics
download is the correct artifact for that audience.

**Constrains:** Body is stored in full — no truncation. Unlike the
auth-failure log (500-character limit, log-line budget), the
diagnostics download has no verbosity constraint and the full stub
body is the diagnostic signal. ``last_stub_body`` is
overwritten on each ``LOAD_INTEGRITY`` event and is never cleared
on successful polls — it must survive into the next diagnostics
download even after recovery. Only resources that returned zero
fulfilled anchors contribute entries; resources that were simply
absent from the resource dict do not.

### Resource-load failure detail via request-shape log

**Decision:** When a loader (HTTP, HNAP, CBN) raises or warns on a
4xx/5xx response, the failure message includes the actual outgoing
request shape — method, full URL with query string, and headers
sent. Header values whose lowercase name is declared by the active
auth strategy via ``BaseAuthManager.headers()`` are replaced with
``<set, len=N>``; everything else is verbatim. Implemented as a
shared ``loaders.diagnostics.describe_request`` helper consumed by
all three loader modules.

**Rationale:** Auth-phase failures already had detail (see prior
decision). Resource-phase failures didn't — the message was
``"HTTP 400 fetching /php/status_docsis_data.php"``. Issue #86
spent four alpha cycles on a TG3442DE 400 because each iteration
shipped a theory ("must be ``_n`` cache-buster", "must be
``ajaxSet_Session``"), the modem rejected the next attempt, and
nothing in the user's log told us *what we actually sent vs what
the browser sends*. The browser's HAR was ground truth; our side
had no symmetric artifact. Including the request shape in the
loader's exception message means the contributor's first failure
log paste IS the diff input.

**Constrains:** Auth strategies own which header names carry
session tokens — they declare them via ``BaseAuthManager.headers()``
(default ``frozenset({"cookie"})``; ``Basic`` adds
``authorization``; ``HNAP`` adds ``hnap_auth``; ``form_sjcl`` /
``form_pbkdf2`` add the configured ``csrf_header``). Loaders treat
this set as opaque — a Core-layer ``headers`` parameter, no
"sensitive" qualifier in the loader API. The wire request is never
modified; redaction only applies when ``describe_request`` formats
the failure log line.

---

## Parsing Architecture

### Three roles: BaseParser, ModemParserCoordinator, parser.py

**Decision:** Parsing has three distinct roles instead of a single
class hierarchy. `BaseParser` (ABC) is the extraction interface with
seven format-specific implementations — including `StructuredParser`
(ABC), an intermediate base for `JSONParser` and `XMLParser` that
holds the shared dict-path extraction pipeline.
`ModemParserCoordinator` is the factory and orchestrator. `parser.py`
is an optional post-processor.

**Rationale:** The original design conflated extraction, orchestration,
and customization into one class — a god class risk. Separating them
makes each independently testable. The coordinator is a thin ~50-line
orchestrator. Extraction complexity lives in `BaseParser`
implementations. parser.py is a hook, not an inheritance override.

**Constrains:** parser.py cannot subclass `BaseParser` or the
coordinator. It receives extraction output + raw resources and returns
final section data. Per-section hooks only (`parse_downstream`,
`parse_upstream`, `parse_system_info`) — no modem-level hook.

### Format selection is per-section, not per-modem

**Decision:** Each parser.yaml section (`downstream`, `upstream`,
`system_info`) declares its own `format` independently. A modem can
mix formats.

**Rationale:** Real modems mix formats — transposed tables for channels
plus JavaScript for system info, or html_fields from multiple pages.
Per-section format selection accommodates this without forcing a
single format choice.

**Constrains:** Every section must explicitly declare its format. No
inheritance, no defaults to guess.

### parser.yaml is primary, parser.py is the escape hatch

**Decision:** At least one of parser.yaml or parser.py is required.
parser.yaml is the primary expression mode. When both exist, parser.yaml
handles standard extraction and parser.py post-processes sections that
need code. When extraction is too complex for declarative config,
parser.py alone is valid.

**Rationale:** Declarative config (parser.yaml) is reviewable,
validatable, and consistent. Code (parser.py) handles genuine
structural variety that can't be expressed declaratively. When a
parser.py pattern recurs across 3+ modems, it graduates to a
parser.yaml config field.

**Constrains:** parser.py hooks cannot make network calls — only
pre-fetched resources are available. parser.py never contains auth
or metadata. modem.yaml never contains extraction logic.

### Promoting `_transpose_nodes` to a Core format

**Decision:** The indexed-pivot JSON shape (`name` + `indexN` rows,
each column a channel) was promoted from `dm1000/parser.py` into a
Core format (`json_transposed`) plus a public
`transpose_indexed_rows` helper. dm1000's `parser.py` keeps the
firmware-specific filter (`Power == "ON"` and `"OPERATE" in STATE`)
and the OFDMA channel build, but no longer owns the pivot.

**Rationale:** A valid HAR capture is enough to ground-truth a
parser format — the captured payload either matches the new format's
output for a given config or it doesn't. That's a different bar than
auth promotion, where end-to-end verification against a live modem
is required because failure modes (challenge replay, cookie
binding, anti-CSRF) only surface against running firmware. We
expect more sercomm-family modems to land with this same indexed-row
shape, and "leave the helper in dm1000 until the second consumer"
forces that contributor to refactor instead of just adding a
parser.yaml. The promotion cost is one model + one parser + registry
wiring — paid once, amortized across future modems.

**Constrains:** The format owns the pivot, type conversion,
`channel_type`, and `filter`. Firmware-specific quirks that aren't
expressible declaratively (substring filters, stateful gating) stay
in `parser.py` and import `transpose_indexed_rows` from the curated
`post_processor_helpers` module to share the pivot logic. New filter
operators added to handle such quirks should land as separate,
additive ADRs — not bundled with format promotions.

### Companion tables merge via config, not code

**Decision:** The `merge_by` field on `tables[]` entries tells the
coordinator to merge companion table fields into primary channels by
declared key fields, instead of appending them as separate channels.

**Rationale:** Some modems split channel data across primary and
companion tables. This was a parser.py use case that
graduated to config. `merge_by` is a list of field names forming the
lookup key — primary table wins on field conflicts.

**Constrains:** All tables in a section share the section-level
`resource`. Companion tables must have matching key fields for the
merge to work.

---

## Session and Action Model

### Signal/policy separation

**Decision:** Protocol layers (auth manager, resource loader, parser)
signal conditions. The orchestrator owns all policy (retry, backoff,
error reporting).

**Rationale:** When a layer both signals a condition and decides what
to do about it, callers inherit hidden policy they can't override.
Keeping signal and policy separate gives the orchestrator full
visibility and full control. Auth strategies raise
`LoginLockoutError` but don't track lockout state. The orchestrator
sets backoff counters and suppresses login attempts.

**Constrains:** Protocol layers never retry, back off, or decide what
to do about failures. All policy state (backoff counters, session
reuse decisions) lives on the orchestrator.

### Session reuse across polls

**Decision:** Sessions persist across polls. The auth manager reuses
valid sessions instead of re-authenticating every cycle.

**Rationale:** HNAP modems have firmware anti-brute-force that can lock
out or reboot the modem after repeated login attempts (HNAP modem
firmware `LOCKUP` and `REBOOT` states). Session reuse
is the primary defense. Backoff (3-poll suppression on lockout) is the
safety net.

**Constrains:** Session state must be maintained across polls. Stale
session detection requires a within-poll retry mechanism (zero channels
on reused session → clear and retry once).

### Two modem-side actions only

**Decision:** Two actions: restart (user-triggered) and logout
(system-triggered). Both share the same action schema with two type
discriminators: `http` and `hnap`.

**Rationale:** The integration's purpose is read-only monitoring.
Restart is the sole state-changing action — a security and
terms-of-service boundary. Logout is session cleanup so users can
access the modem's web UI between polls. No other modem commands
are supported.

**Constrains:** Cannot add modem commands beyond restart without
expanding the action model. This is intentional.

---

## Recovery Architecture

### Restart is a command, recovery is a window

**Decision:** `Orchestrator.restart()` is a one-shot command
(authenticate → execute action → clear session → trigger recovery →
return). It does not probe, does not wait for operational, does not
observe the reboot. Anything that happens after the command lands is
handled by a separate "recovery" module that owns polling cadence
for a bounded window.

**Rationale:** The earlier design conflated the *command* (send a
reboot instruction) with the *recovery observation* (watch until the
modem is operational again). These are separable concerns with
different contracts. The command is transactional — it either
dispatches cleanly or it doesn't. Recovery is a polling-cadence
concern — HOW OFTEN to poll for a while after a disruption. Merging
them produced a restart method that blocked for three minutes,
needed cancellation plumbing, owned its own probe loop, and
duplicated work that external-reboot detection also needed.

Splitting them lets each do one thing. Restart becomes ~5 lines.
Recovery becomes a single module that any trigger (command, observed
outage, heuristic) can ask to enter a window. The Status sensor
always reflects real snapshot state (Unreachable → ranging → Operational);
no synthetic "Restarting…" label. The restart button returns quickly;
the dashboard tells the user what's actually happening.

**Constrains:** Restart never waits, never times out, never
cancels. Its only failure mode is `command_failed` (auth or action
executor raised). Recovery cannot be triggered by caller request
other than the three defined paths (command, observed failure,
reboot-signal check). Consumers cannot observe recovery window
progress — they see the snapshot stream and react to that.

### One recovery concept, multiple triggers

**Decision:** Recovery is a unified module — `orchestration/recovery.py` —
with a single state (`active: bool`) and three entry triggers:
command dispatched, observed connectivity outage, and a reboot-
signal check on successful polls. All three enter the same window
with the same behavior.

**Rationale:** The modem's physical state — "not fully operational,
expected to return" — is the same regardless of what triggered it.
Modeling it as one thing with multiple triggers matches reality.
The earlier design had two implementations (inline wait for
commanded, flag+observer for detected) running in parallel; they
shared a deadline constant, differed in everything else, and
required the orchestrator to arbitrate between them. The unified
module removes the arbitration.

Triggers differ only in how they recognize "recovery is needed."
The recovery module's reaction is the same: open a window, let
polls run at a faster cadence, close the window when the window
duration expires. Exit is time-based, not snapshot-based — that
sidesteps the "should we exit on OPERATIONAL?" inference trap.

**Constrains:** New trigger paths go through the recovery module's
existing entry API (`begin(reason)`, `evaluate_snapshot`,
`evaluate_failure`). No other module owns polling loops, deadlines,
or cadence decisions. The orchestrator delegates; the collector has
no knowledge of recovery.

### Generic timing, not per-modem knobs

**Decision:** Recovery timing lives as class attributes on
`Recovery` in `orchestration/recovery.py` (e.g. `WINDOW_SECONDS`).
Modem YAML and action models carry no timing fields.

**Rationale:** Per-modem tuning was tried in v3.14 alpha and
removed. "How long a reboot takes" varies by firmware version, CMTS
load, and DOCSIS ranging — none of which are modem-class
characteristics. Bench-tuning values per modem doesn't scale:
firmware updates silently invalidate them, and a value too short or
too long produces misleading UX or wasted polls.

**Constrains:** New modems cannot introduce grace/timeout fields on
action models or in `modem.yaml`. Recovery timing is a global
concern. If future needs justify user-configurable cadence/window
settings, they live in HA's options flow, not per-modem config.

### Reboot-signal trigger is a simple threshold vote, bounded harm

**Decision:** The "did a reboot happen between polls?" trigger is a
2-of-3 vote over three observables: counter reset, uptime drop,
transitional docsis. Implemented as a private method
`_check_reboot_signals` on the `Recovery` class — no separate
module, no weights, no probabilities, no inference framing. Its
output is binary: "trigger a recovery window, or don't."

**Rationale:** An earlier sketch called this "recovery heuristics"
and lived in its own module with inference framing. That oversold
both the complexity and the uncertainty of the logic. It's boolean
logic over observables — a simple vote. The state it needs
(previous counter totals, previous uptime) belongs with
Recovery's other state; splitting it created a seam where there
wasn't a real boundary.

A false positive (two signals match without a real reboot) causes
polling to run faster for a bounded window and nothing else. No UX
misrepresentation (the snapshot still reports whatever the modem
reports), no misleading labels, no stalls. That blast-radius cap
is why the threshold can stay simple.

**Constrains:** The reboot-signal check cannot set status, cannot
publish UX state, cannot extend window duration. It returns a
reason string (e.g. `"reboot_signals:counter_reset+transitional_docsis"`)
or None. If the rule grows more complex — weighted scoring,
per-modem opt-outs, user-level disable — it graduates to its own
module then. Not now.

### Core→HA recovery coupling via observer callback

**Decision:** `Orchestrator.set_recovery_observer(callback)` lets
the HA adapter register a callable that fires when
`recovery_active` flips (False→True on window entry, True→False on
window exit). HA wires this to `dispatcher_send` so the data
coordinator switches between normal and recovery cadence, and the
restart button's enabled state updates promptly.

**Rationale:** Core cannot import `homeassistant.*` (principle #3).
Polling `recovery_active` from HA would lag by a coordinator cycle
and miss rapid transitions. An observer callback keeps Core
platform-agnostic while giving HA immediate, thread-safe
notification when state changes on the Core poll thread. The
"poll faster for a while" loop lives in HA (via
`coordinator.update_interval`), not in Core — Core only signals
state.

**Constrains:** New Core→HA state signals follow the same observer
pattern, not shared mutable state or HA-side polling. Observer
callbacks must be safe to call from the Core poll thread. Any
"check until condition" loops triggered by Core state live in HA
using its native scheduling primitives.

## Testing Strategy

### HAR replay as integration tests

**Decision:** Each modem's `tests/` directory contains HAR captures
(pipeline input) and expected output golden files (assertions). The
test harness replays each HAR through the `HARMockServer`, runs the full
pipeline, and compares output against the golden file.

**Rationale:** HAR captures are engine-independent HTTP recordings —
the most durable test fixture. Golden files capture reviewed output
against which all future runs are regression tests. If a `BaseParser`
implementation changes, all modems using that format are automatically
retested (regression firewall).

**Constrains:** Adding a modem requires a HAR capture and a reviewed
golden file. No test code in Catalog — only data files.

### Greenfield from specs, not migration from prior versions

**Decision:** No code reuse from prior versions. Build from the specs
using HAR files as the evidence base.

**Rationale:** Migration creates pressure to preserve old patterns.
"This test already exists, let's adapt it" leads to old assumptions
leaking in. A repeatable HAR-driven generation process is both cleaner
and more scalable — works identically for modem #1 and modem #33.

**Constrains:** Prior test intent (same modem, same input, same
expected output) is preserved through golden files, not through
migrated test code.

---

## Onboarding

### MCP tools for deterministic steps, Claude for judgment

**Decision:** An MCP server provides structured tools for modem
onboarding. Deterministic steps (HAR parsing, transport detection,
config generation, validation, test execution) are code. Claude handles
judgment calls (ambiguous HTML formats, metadata web search, test
failure diagnosis). The user handles approval.

**Rationale:** Deterministic logic in MCP tools is repeatable and
testable — not dependent on LLM reasoning for correctness. The
config constraints (transport, auth, format) form the decision framework.
Ambiguity is a hard stop, not a guess.

**Constrains:** HAR validation is a gate — post-auth-only HARs,
missing auth flows, and ambiguous transports halt analysis. No guessing.
Metadata not in the HAR is filled via web search with source
provenance.

### catalog_tools owns the onboarding spec

**Decision:** `ONBOARDING_SPEC.md` lives in catalog_tools' docs.
(Previously in Core's docs; moved in the v3.14 catalog_tools
carve-out.)

**Rationale:** The onboarding process generates Catalog content but
is executed by catalog_tools using Core's validation, test harness,
and schema definitions. Core remains the authority on what
constitutes a valid modem config; catalog_tools is the package that
*exercises* Core's schemas to produce content. The spec describing
the authoring pipeline belongs with the package that implements it.

**Constrains:** catalog_tools depends on Core's schema validators
and test harness. Core does not depend on catalog_tools; the
onboarding spec does not belong in Core's surface area.

## Extension Model

### How to add a modem

Add a directory under `modems/{manufacturer}/{model}/` with:

- `modem.yaml` — identity, auth, session, hardware, metadata
- `parser.yaml` — declarative extraction config
- `parser.py` — optional post-processor (only if needed)
- `tests/modem.har` + `tests/modem.expected.json` — HAR and golden file

No registration. No changes to Core or Catalog package code. Drop-in.

### How to add a format

Each format is described in **one place** — the section/source model
— via three ``ClassVar``s. Loaders, validators, and parser registries
all derive from the model lists; adding a format does not require
editing format-list frozensets in multiple files.

1. **`models/parser_config/{format}.py`** — define the model with:
   - `format_tag: ClassVar[str]` — value of ``format:`` in parser.yaml
   - `decode_kind: ClassVar[DecodeKind]` — `"html"`, `"json"`, `"xml"`,
     or `"hnap"` (drives the loader's body decoder and login-page
     detection)
   - `transports: ClassVar[frozenset[str]]` — which transports may
     select this format (drives cross-file transport/format validation)
   - The familiar Pydantic schema (`model_config`, `format: Literal["..."]`,
     fields)
2. **`models/parser_config/config.py`** (channel sections) **or**
   **`system_info.py`** (system_info sources) — append the model class
   to the list (`CHANNEL_SECTION_MODELS` or
   `SYSTEM_INFO_SOURCE_MODELS`). The discriminated union, the loader's
   decode dispatch, and the cross-file validator's transport map all
   derive from these lists.
3. **`parsers/formats/{format}.py`** — implement the `BaseParser`
   subclass.
4. **`parsers/registries.py`** — define the wrapper that adapts the
   parser to `(section, resources) -> list[dict]` (or `dict` for
   sysinfo) and add a `format_tag → wrapper` entry to
   `_CHANNEL_WRAPPERS_BY_TAG` (or `_SYSINFO_WRAPPERS_BY_TAG`). The
   model→callable dict is built by zipping the registry list with
   this table — a missing entry raises at import time.

**Why ClassVars on the model.** Auth strategies already use this
pattern (`AuthStrategyBase` with `display_name`/`transport` ClassVars +
`_AUTH_MODELS` list). Format metadata is the same shape: a few
attributes that cross-cutting machinery needs to know about. Putting
them on the model keeps everything about a format colocated and lets
the loader, validator, and registry derive their views.

**Why wrappers stay in `registries.py`.** The wrappers contain
format-specific orchestration (channel_number assignment, multi-table
`merge_by`, unified-channel handling) that doesn't fit cleanly into
the BaseParser interface. Pulling them into format modules would
spread orchestration across N files; keeping them in `registries.py`
keeps that policy in one place. The `_CHANNEL_WRAPPERS_BY_TAG` dict
is the only per-format addition outside the model.

### Curated public-helper surface for parser.py

**Decision:** ``parser.py`` PostProcessors that need shared logic from
Core import it from a single curated module —
``solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_core.post_processor_helpers`` — and
nothing else. The parser-sandbox validator allowlists this exact
fully-qualified module path; all other Core paths remain forbidden.

**Rationale:** The sandbox is what keeps PostProcessors honest (no
network I/O, no auth state access, no orchestrator peeking). Allowing
unrestricted Core imports defeats it; banning all Core imports forces
DRY violations when a primitive (e.g., `transpose_indexed_rows`) is
useful both in a Core format and in a firmware-quirk PostProcessor.
A single audited public surface threads the needle: helpers added
there are reviewed for parser.py safety, and the sandbox enforces
that no other Core path can be reached.

**Constrains:** Adding a helper means importing/defining it in
`post_processor_helpers.py` and listing it in `__all__`. Renaming or
removing one is a breaking change for catalog `parser.py` files —
keep churn low. Helpers that need network or stateful orchestrator
access do not belong here.

### How to add an auth strategy

1. **`models/modem_config/auth.py`** — three co-located additions:
   - Define the model class inheriting from `AuthStrategyBase` with
     `display_name` and `transport` ClassVars.
   - Add an `Annotated[NewAuth, Tag("strategy_name")]` member to the
     `AuthConfig` union.
   - Add the class to the `_AUTH_MODELS` registry list (immediately
     below the union).
2. **`auth/{strategy}.py`** — new manager module with a
   `create_manager(config)` entry point.
3. **`test_harness/auth/{strategy}.py`** — new handler module with a
   `create_handler(modem_config, har_entries)` entry point.

Three files, all additive. No factory code changes — the factory
dynamically imports the manager module by strategy literal. Display
labels and transport validation sets derive from the model ClassVars.
No existing strategy code is touched.

**If you forget a step:** missing union member → modem.yaml fails to
parse at config load time. Missing `_AUTH_MODELS` entry → display
label and transport validation missing, caught by fleet test. Neither
failure is silent.

**Strategy selection is config-driven** — declared in modem.yaml,
never guessed at runtime. The dynamic import resolves a declared
strategy to its implementation; it does not discover which strategy
to use.

**If the strategy pre-fetches a login page, use the response.** Four
of nine strategies pre-fetch a page as part of the auth handshake
(`form`, `form_sjcl`, `form_cbn`, `url_token`). Each extracts
session-specific state from the response — hidden fields, crypto
parameters, cookies, or tokens. The pre-fetch establishes session
cookies as a side effect, but its primary purpose is reading the
data the handshake needs. Discarding the response body is a bug.

### How to add a transport

Add a new loader (new value type), new `BaseParser` implementation(s)
that consume that type, a new row in the constraint table, and
validator updates. No existing code changes.

## Config Flow

### Cross-directory grouping for same-model, different-transport entries

**Decision:** `list_modems()` groups catalog directories by
`(manufacturer.lower(), model.lower())`. The first directory encountered
in sorted path order becomes primary; additional matches are attached as
`sibling_dirs`. The config flow passes `sibling_dirs` to `list_variants()`,
which scans all directories and returns a flat combined list. Transport is
a variant dimension, not a dropdown dimension.

**Rationale:** The MODEM_YAML_SPEC rule "different transport = different
directory" is correct and must not change — directories are independently
testable. But users should not have to know the catalog directory structure.
Grouping at the `list_modems()` layer keeps each directory self-contained
while presenting a single logical entry in the UI.

**Constrains:** Variant dropdown values use composite keys
(`"{rel_dir}/{name|__default__}"`) to prevent collisions when multiple
directories each contribute a default variant. The selected directory is
stored as `_selected_modem_dir` on the config flow and used for all
downstream steps (auth strategy resolution, connection validation, config
entry storage).

### Hardware version as the user-facing variant discriminator

**Decision:** `hardware.hw_version` is the field shown in the variant
dropdown when multiple entries share the same auth strategy. `hardware.firmware`
is recorded as catalog metadata but not shown in the UI.

**Rationale:** Hardware version is printed on the modem sticker — users can
physically verify it without navigating the modem's web UI. Firmware codes
(AB01, TB01) are meaningful to contributors and maintainers but opaque to
users during setup.

**Constrains:** `hw_version` must be omitted when the variant name (from the
filename stem) already communicates the version to the user — duplication
degrades the label. `firmware` should always be recorded when known as it is
useful for future tooling and contributor reference.
