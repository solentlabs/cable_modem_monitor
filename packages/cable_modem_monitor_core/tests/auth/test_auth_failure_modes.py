"""Every auth strategy declares how to read a post-login 401.

``BaseAuthManager.auth_failure_mode`` decides whether a 401 arriving
after a "successful" login means the session was refused or the
password was wrong all along. The default is pessimistic; overriding
to ``SESSION_REJECTED`` is a claim that the strategy rejects a bad
password at login time.

That claim is paid for by a bad-password test living with the strategy
it describes:

- ``form_pbkdf2`` — ``test_form_pbkdf2.py::TestFormPbkdf2AuthManager::
  test_wrong_password_fails_login``
- ``hnap`` — ``test_hnap.py::test_login_failure``
- ``form`` **with success criteria** — below, in both directions per
  criterion: ``test_form_with_success_criteria_rejects_bad_password`` and
  ``test_form_success_criteria_decide_both_ways``

The strategies that cannot tell get the inverse test here, pinning the
fact that a wrong password sails through login. That is precisely why
their post-login 401 must not be reported as "your password is fine".

See ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md "Post-login 401 is read per auth
strategy".
