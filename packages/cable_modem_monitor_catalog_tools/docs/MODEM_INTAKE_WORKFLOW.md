# Modem Intake Workflow

Onboard a new cable modem from a HAR capture to a tested catalog entry.
If the modem uses patterns Core already knows, onboarding is fully
automated. If the modem uses something new, the pipeline stops with
a clear report of what Core needs to support.

> **The HAR capture is the only authoritative input.** Every config
> decision traces to wire evidence in the capture. Without a complete
> HAR — including the authentication flow — the pipeline cannot run
> and a parser cannot be built. Recapture is always the answer to a
> bad HAR; there is no workaround.

> **Authoritative spec:** [ONBOARDING_SPEC.md](ONBOARDING_SPEC.md)
> covers tool contracts, decision trees, validation rules, worked examples,
> and error handling in full detail. This document is the runnable workflow.

## Audience

This walkthrough is for anyone with a HAR capture who wants to produce
a draft catalog entry — whether that's the modem owner working on their
own hardware, or a contributor helping triage someone else's submission.

The pipeline tooling is plain Python, but the judgment work — format
detection on ambiguous HTML, metadata enrichment, test failure
diagnosis, modem config shaping — realistically benefits from an AI
assistant. This project itself was built with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).
If you have access to a similar AI tool, treat it as the expected
helper for the judgment steps; if not, expect those steps to take
more reading and iteration against the specs.

> Throughout this doc: when you're triaging someone else's HAR, anything
> that asks "you" to confirm a value routes back to the original filer.
> When you're working on your own modem, you confirm with yourself.

## Prerequisites

- Repo cloned and the dev environment working (`make validate` green).
  See [docs/setup/GETTING_STARTED.md](../../../docs/setup/GETTING_STARTED.md)
  for one-time setup. Standard setup installs Core, Catalog, and
  catalog_tools together in editable mode.
- A `.sanitized.har` file. Capture is done with
  [solentlabs/har-capture](https://github.com/solentlabs/har-capture),
  this project's own tool — which means it's editable when a modem
  needs special handling (pre-flight headers, custom URL filters,
  non-standard auth flows). PRs to extend `har-capture` itself are
  welcome. For the standard capture walkthrough, see
  [docs/MODEM_REQUEST.md](../../../docs/MODEM_REQUEST.md). If a HAR
  has cookies on the first request and no auth flow, recapture in
  incognito/private browsing — the pipeline will reject it.

## HAR Captures Are Immutable Evidence

A HAR represents actual hardware we do not own or control. Never
edit one — not to fix malformed HTML, normalize endpoints, or tidy
payloads. Broken markup in a capture is firmware behavior the parser
must handle, not noise to clean: correcting bad tags in a HAR once
caused a modem that really returns bad tags to be processed
incorrectly. The only sanctioned transformation is PII value
sanitization at intake, which replaces values and never structure.

### Reconstructed fixtures

Not every fixture is a wire capture. Before har-capture existed,
entries were routinely assembled from user-supplied HTML and
diagnostics (`creator` values like `fixtures_to_har (synthetic)`,
`synthetic`, and `composite (fixture + har-capture)` across the
fleet record this). The practice is legitimate; this section
codifies the rules it must follow.

When no HAR exists but a sibling model's live parse output proves
structural compatibility (a diagnostics capture showing the sibling's
parser fully extracting channels on the new hardware), a fixture may
be *reconstructed*: the sibling's HAR is used as the structural
template and every parsed value is substituted with the real values
observed in the diagnostics. This is not an edited capture — it is a
new artifact that must declare itself:

- `log.creator.name` identifies the fixture as reconstructed (the
  fleet convention: synthetic fixtures self-identify in `creator`).
- `log.comment` in the HAR states it is reconstructed, names the
  template model, the evidence issue, and lists every unobserved
  template-filler field (e.g. lock status, symbol rates).
- The `modem.yaml` `notes:` block repeats the provenance and says the
  fixture is replaced when a real HAR arrives.
- The entry ships as `status: awaiting_verification`, never
  `confirmed`.
- The reconstruction is only valid when the parsed diagnostics values
  round-trip: run the parser over the reconstructed HAR and diff the
  output against the diagnostics — zero mismatches required.

First use under these codified rules: Technicolor XB8 (CGM4981COM),
issue #101, reconstructed from the XB7 fixture plus a v3.12.0
diagnostics capture.

## Inputs

You provide one of:

- A HAR file path (local) — most common when you're working on your own modem.
- A GitHub issue number with an attached HAR — when triaging a submission.
- A modem manufacturer + model name — looks up an existing HAR in the catalog (useful for re-running the pipeline on a known-good HAR, e.g. after a Core change).

## Pipeline Flow

```text
validate_har -> scan_fleet -> analyze_har(fleet) -> [check for gaps]
    -> enrich_metadata -> generate_config(fleet) -> generate_golden_file
    -> write_modem_package -> run_tests -> [fix failures] -> show changes
```

Two outcomes:

- **Clean pipeline (no gaps):** produces catalog files
- **Gaps detected:** reports what Core doesn't support and stops

## Step 1: Obtain HAR

If you have a local file (your own capture, or one downloaded from an
issue), use the path directly.

If you're triaging a submitted issue:

```bash
gh issue view <number> --json body,comments
```

Extract the HAR attachment URL from the body and download it to a temp
directory.

## Step 2: Validate HAR

```python
from solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools.validate_har import validate_har
result = validate_har(har_path)
```

If `result.valid is False`: stop and address the issues before going
further. Validation catches structural problems and missing auth flows
early — there is no point scanning the fleet or running analysis on a
bad HAR. Common fix: HAR was captured against an existing session
(post-auth). Recapture in incognito/private browsing.

## Step 3: Scan Fleet Patterns

```python
from solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_catalog import CATALOG_PATH
from solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools.fleet_scanner import scan_fleet

fleet = scan_fleet(CATALOG_PATH)
```

Fleet patterns augment Core's baseline detection with proven patterns
from existing modems (selector directions, system_info labels, aggregate
fields). Pass `fleet` to both `analyze_har` and `generate_config`.

## Step 4: Analyze HAR

```python
from solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools.analyze_har import analyze_har
result = analyze_har(har_path, fleet=fleet)
analysis = result.to_dict()
```

Check three outputs:

1. **`hard_stops`** — if non-empty, report and stop
2. **`warnings`** — note for later, don't stop
3. **`core_gaps`** — if present, report and stop (Step 5)

Report what was detected:

- Transport: `{analysis["transport"]}`
- Auth: `{analysis["auth"]["strategy"]}` (confidence: `{analysis["auth"]["confidence"]}`)
- Actions: logout={observed/source_inferred/none}, restart={observed/source_inferred/none}
  - `observed` — request appeared in HAR traffic (highest confidence)
  - `source_inferred` — endpoint referenced in captured page source or matches a
    working family-member modem in the catalog (add to config; flag for contributor
    confirmation that the endpoint works and, separately, whether a Cookie header
    appears in the logout request — `requires_session: true/false` is behavioral
    and cannot be inferred from the HAR alone)
  - `none` — not found by either method; request from the contributor before adding config
- Sections: list formats and channel counts

For source_inferred actions found at a `$.ajax({...})` call site, the
method and data params are extracted from the call site itself (see
ONBOARDING_SPEC § Source-Inferred Call-Site Extraction). Params that
resolve — `{cookie:<name>}` directives and string literals — need no
manual work. A warning naming an unresolved param (a value computed in
page script) marks the one remaining judgment step: read the quoted
expression in the page source and resolve the value by hand. Never
invent a value the page source doesn't support; if it can't be traced,
leave the param out and ask the contributor.

Two rules govern this layer:

- **Patterns come from confirmed modems only.** New URL regexes in
  `action_patterns.json` and new call-shape support in the extractor
  are authored from hardware-confirmed modems. Unconfirmed intakes
  consume patterns; they never contribute them.
- **Every extraction rule must fire on at least one committed fleet
  HAR.** A proposed rule with zero fleet matches is dead weight built
  for a hypothesis — reject it. `make intake-regression` grades
  detected actions against committed modem.yaml files and ratchets
  them against the fleet baseline (see INTAKE_PIPELINE.md § Intake
  Pipeline Regression) — an extractor change must improve grades or
  leave them unchanged.

If `auth.confidence` is not `high`, or `warnings` is non-empty for the auth
entry, verify the detected strategy against the HAR before proceeding. Pull
`analysis["auth"]["fields"]` and cross-check:

| Strategy | Key signal in the HAR |
|----------|-----------------------|
| `form` | Login is a POST with plain form fields. If `login_page` is set, a pre-fetch GET precedes the POST and hidden fields appear in the POST body. Check `encoding` — `base64` if the password is base64-encoded in the POST body, `plain` if it appears verbatim. |
| `form_nonce` | Auth response body starts with `Url:` (success) or `Error:` (failure) — no HTTP redirect. The POST body contains a short random numeric value alongside credentials; `nonce_field` should match its field name. |
| `form_pbkdf2` | A preliminary request fires before credentials are submitted and the response contains a salt value. `pbkdf2_iterations` and `pbkdf2_key_length` should match values visible in that exchange. |
| `form_sjcl` | The credential POST body is an encrypted SJCL JSON blob, not plain form fields. `encrypt_aad` and `decrypt_aad` should match the AAD strings in the login JS. |

If the detected strategy or any extracted field looks wrong, correct
`analysis["auth"]` before calling `generate_config` — don't patch the
generated YAML after the fact.

## Step 5: Check for Core Gaps

If `analysis["core_gaps"]` is present, the modem uses a pattern Core
doesn't support yet. **Stop config generation.** Report:

1. What was successfully detected (transport, session, etc.)
2. For each gap:
   - **Category**: what kind of pattern is missing
   - **Summary**: human-readable description
   - **Evidence**: wire data from the HAR
3. Suggest next steps:
   - `unmatched_login`: new login URL pattern needed in `auth_patterns.json`,
     or a new auth strategy needed in Core
   - `auth_unknown`: new auth strategy needed in Core
   - `unmatched_restart` / `unmatched_logout`: new action URL pattern needed
     in `action_patterns.json`

Format the report so it can be pasted into a GitHub issue for a
development effort. Do NOT try to resolve gaps by patching the
analysis dict.

If no gaps: proceed to Step 6.

## Step 6: Enrich Metadata

```python
from solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools.enrich_metadata import enrich_metadata
enrich_result = enrich_metadata(analysis, existing_config=None, user_input=user_metadata)
metadata = enrich_result.metadata
```

For each item in `enrich_result.missing`:

- **hardware.chipset**: web search `"{manufacturer} {model} chipset"`
- **hardware.docsis_version**: check if OFDM channels detected (= 3.1), else 3.0
- **hardware.release_date**: web search the launch announcement
  (manufacturer press release, ISP rollout coverage). An FCC grant or
  dated manufacturer manual is an acceptable proxy — label it as such
  in `sources.release_date`. Feeds the catalog README timeline;
  entries without it are silently omitted from that rendering.
- **isps**: web search `"{model} compatible ISPs"`
- **default_host**: usually 192.168.100.1 for DOCSIS modems
- **brands**: user-visible box branding. Check firmware brand fields in
  the HAR (e.g. `customer`) and retail listings. Entries become
  manufacturer-dropdown buckets and must carry a source.
- **model_aliases**: alternate user-facing names only — rebadges,
  regional variants, sticker codes, each with a source. Firmware
  `product`/platform codes stay in the HAR as evidence; they never go
  in aliases (this is how the G54 got bad aliases, see #72).

`manufacturer` is stored as the firmware reports it and determines the
catalog directory; box branding that differs goes in `brands`. Full
research guidance: ONBOARDING_SPEC.md § Fields to research.

Confirm any values you can't find rather than guessing.

## Step 7: Generate Config

```python
from solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools.generate_config import generate_config
result = generate_config(analysis, metadata, fleet=fleet)
```

If `result.validation.valid is False`:

- Read the errors
- Fix the analysis dict or metadata
- Retry

Review the generated YAML before proceeding.

## Step 8: Generate Golden File + Write Package

```python
from solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools.generate_golden_file import generate_golden_file
golden = generate_golden_file(str(har_path), result.parser_yaml)
```

Report channel counts for sanity check:

- Downstream: N channels, fields: [list]
- Upstream: N channels, fields: [list]
- System info: [list of fields]

If `result.missing_system_info_fields` is non-empty, inspect the HAR for
those fields before proceeding. Search the response bodies for the field
name or a likely label (e.g., "uptime", "Up Time") and add the mapping to
the parser.yaml. A parser that ships without a Tier-1 field will fail
`verify_diagnostics` at confirmation time.

Then write the catalog package:

```python
from solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools.write_modem_package import write_modem_package
write_result = write_modem_package(output_dir, ...)
```

See [ONBOARDING_SPEC.md](ONBOARDING_SPEC.md) for the full
`write_modem_package` signature.

## Step 9: Run Tests

```python
from solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_core.test_harness.runner import run_tests
test_result = run_tests(modem_dir)
```

If tests fail, diagnose from the structured diff:

- **Auth failure**: check modem.yaml auth fields against HAR login flow
- **404 on resource**: check parser.yaml resource paths vs HAR URLs
- **Empty channels**: check column indices/field offsets
- **Golden mismatch**: compare field-by-field diff

Fix the config, re-run. Loop until green.

The new modem is picked up automatically — discovery walks the catalog
tree, so there is no index or baseline to update. `make
intake-regression` simply includes it in the accuracy report on the
next run.

## Step 10: Regenerate Catalog README

Run the generator to keep the catalog index current:

```bash
python3 packages/cable_modem_monitor_catalog/scripts/generate_catalog_index.py
```

Stage `README.md` and `CATALOG_AUDIT.md` alongside the catalog files —
CI gates on README freshness and a stale README will fail the PR.

## Step 11: Show Changes

Run `git status` to see all files created or modified, and
`git diff --stat` for a summary. Do NOT commit or push automatically —
staging and commits are yours to make.

## Step 12: Open a Pull Request

Once tests are green and the diff looks right:

1. Create a branch, stage the new catalog files, commit with a clear
   message (e.g. `Add catalog entry for {manufacturer} {model}`).
2. Open a PR against `main` (or the active release branch). Reference
   the originating issue with `Related to #N` — never `Fixes #N`
   (see [CONTRIBUTING.md § Issue Closing Policy](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md#issue-closing-policy)).
3. Include in the PR description: the verdict from the HAR audit (if
   you ran one), channel counts from Step 8, and any unresolved
   warnings from `analyze_har`.

A maintainer reviews and merges. The modem lands in the catalog with
`status: awaiting_verification`. The Confirmation Phase below closes
the loop once a contributor reports the parser working on real
hardware.

## Confirmation Phase

After the catalog entry ships in a release, the contributor who filed
the original request (or any user with matching hardware) eventually
reports back from a real install. When their diagnostics show the
parser working, the maintainer captures that evidence as a
`*.verified.json` fixture and flips the `modem.yaml` status to
`confirmed`. This phase is maintainer-side; the contributor's only
job is to share their HA diagnostics download.

### Step 13: Receive Hardware Confirmation

Trigger: the originating issue gets a comment with a config-entry
diagnostics JSON attached and a positive report (channels populated,
no errors, "it works").

Open the diagnostics JSON and sanity-check:

- `data.modem_data.error` is empty
- `data.data_coordinator.last_update_success` is `true`
- `data.downstream_channels` and `data.upstream_channels` have the
  expected counts and locked entries with full fields (frequency,
  power, snr, corrected/uncorrected where applicable)
- `data.system_info` populated (docsis_status, system_uptime,
  hardware_version, software_version, total_corrected,
  total_uncorrected)
- `data.config_entry.variant` matches the variant the contributor
  used (relevant for multi-variant modems — see Gotchas)

If anything is missing or wrong, treat it as another iteration: ask
clarifying questions, ship a patch alpha, and wait for fresh
diagnostics. Do NOT confirm partial wins.

### Step 14: Build verified.json

The verified.json is a faithful copy of the diagnostics `data`
section, with integration-side noise stripped and provenance metadata
prepended. It is **not** a curated subset — keep all modem-side data
verbatim so future schema work can diff against real hardware output.

Strip these top-level keys from `data`:

- `home_assistant`
- `custom_components`
- `integration_manifest`
- `setup_times`
- `_solentlabs`
- `_review_before_sharing`
- `recent_logs`

Prepend at the top of the resulting object:

```json
{
  "verified_at": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "version": "<release tag, e.g. 3.14.0-beta.1>",
  ...
}
```

Render channel arrays compact — one channel object per line:

```json
"downstream_channels": [
  {"lock_status": "locked", "channel_type": "qam", "channel_id": 17, ...},
  {"lock_status": "locked", "channel_type": "qam", "channel_id": 18, ...},
  ...
]
```

This is the convention used by the majority of existing verified.json
files. Keep dict bodies indented normally; only the channel-array
elements are compact.

Save to: `packages/cable_modem_monitor_catalog/.../<manufacturer>/<model>/test_data/<variant>.verified.json`.

For single-variant modems, the file is `modem.verified.json`. For
multi-variant modems, name it after the variant the contributor used
(e.g. `modem-basic.verified.json`).

### Step 15: Flip Status

Edit `modem.yaml` (or the variant-specific YAML):

```yaml
status: awaiting_verification  →  status: confirmed
```

For multi-variant modems, **only flip the variant the contributor
verified.** A confirmation on one variant does not transfer to the
others — each variant exercises a different transport/auth path and
must be verified independently.

### Step 15a: Run Catalog Tests

After flipping status, run the full catalog test suite before
committing:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest packages/cable_modem_monitor_catalog/tests/ --no-header -q
```

`test_confirmed_modem_golden_spec_conformance` only fires for confirmed
modems, so this is the first time it runs for this entry. A parser
that passed `test_modem_har_replay` during onboarding can still fail
the conformance gate here — the two tests check different things.
Fix any failures before proceeding to Step 16. If the golden needs
updating after a parser fix, regenerate with the actual output from
the failing test run and re-run until clean.

### Step 16: Commit and Reply

Stage the two files and commit with this message shape:

```text
feat(catalog): mark <Make> <Model> [(<variant>)] as confirmed

Verified by @<github-handle> on <release-tag> hardware (HW <ver>,
SW <ver>, <uptime or other distinguishing detail>, <DS> DS + <US> US
locked, all signals nominal).

Refreshes <variant>.verified.json from their diagnostics; flips
<modem.yaml | modem-<variant>.yaml> status awaiting_verification ->
confirmed. <Note any sibling variants that remain awaiting_verification
and what would be needed to confirm them.>

Related to #<issue>
```

Reply on the originating issue with a short, personal close: thank
the contributor, point them at the `Cable Modem Monitor: Generate
Dashboard` action under **Developer Tools > Actions**, and invite a
fresh issue if anything looks off later. Then close the issue.

## Confirmation Gotchas

These came out of real confirmations and are easy to miss on a first
pass.

### Channel-array format

Compact (one channel per line) is the convention. If you generate a
verified.json with `json.dumps(..., indent=2)` you'll get the
expanded form by default — reformat the channel arrays before
committing. The compact form keeps the diff readable when fixture
data churns and matches every other file in the catalog.

### verified.json is a point-in-time snapshot

Each `verified.json` reflects what the integration emitted at the
moment of confirmation, against the integration version cited in the
file's `version` field. The integration's diagnostics shape evolves
over time (fields get added, renamed, restructured) — that's normal,
and historical fixtures don't need to track those changes.

**Match the current diagnostics shape on the file you're writing
now.** Don't normalize older files retroactively. If a future
diagnostics change makes a historical fixture genuinely obsolete,
re-confirmation is the answer, not in-place editing.

### Catalog directory vs self-reported model

A modem's catalog directory name doesn't always match the model
string the firmware reports in diagnostics. For example, the modem
may self-report as `S33` while the catalog directory is `s33v2` to
distinguish hardware revisions. The `verify_diagnostics` CLI accepts
`--manufacturer` / `--model` overrides to bridge this gap.

### Multi-variant modems

A modem with `modem.yaml` plus one or more `modem-<variant>.yaml`
files (e.g. `modem-basic.yaml` for a Basic Auth variant of the same
hardware) has independent test_data and independent status per
variant. Each variant is its own confirmation surface:

- One contributor's confirmation only validates the variant their
  config_entry shows in `data.config_entry.variant`
- Sibling variants stay `awaiting_verification` until a different
  contributor (or the same contributor in different conditions)
  exercises that path
- The commit message must name which variant was confirmed and call
  out which siblings remain unverified

### Diagnostics partial wins

A diagnostics JSON can show "most things working" — channels
populated, latency healthy — while one or two `system_info` fields
are still null. That's not a confirmation; that's an alpha cycle.
Confirm only when the full system_info block is populated and there
are no errors in `modem_data`.

## Key Rules

1. **HAR is the authority.** Two tiers of wire evidence are valid:
   - **Observed** — the request appears in HAR traffic. Use directly, full confidence.
   - **Source-inferred** — the endpoint is referenced in captured page source AND/OR
     confirmed by a working family-member modem in the catalog. Add to config and note
     as inferred; the pipeline marks these automatically via `source: source_inferred`.
   If neither condition is met, request the information from the contributor. Do not guess.
2. **Known patterns are automated.** If the pipeline can classify
   everything, config generation is deterministic. No LLM reasoning
   needed for the common case.
3. **Unknown patterns are Core gaps.** If the pipeline can't classify
   something, stop and report. Don't try to resolve it -- that's a
   development effort, not an intake task.
4. **Only the catalog changes.** Onboarding a new modem should only add
   files to `packages/cable_modem_monitor_catalog/`. If Core changes
   are needed, that's a gap to flag.
5. **Iterate on test failures.** Expect the first run to fail. Diagnose,
   fix, re-run. This is normal.
6. **Never commit automatically.** Show changes; stage them yourself.
7. **Alias vs separate entry.** Each model a user would purchase by name
   gets its own catalog directory — but a separate entry requires its
   own HAR evidence; until a capture exists, a rebadge is recorded as a
   sourced alias on the evidenced entry. Aliases hold alternate
   user-facing names only (rebadges, sticker codes); firmware-internal
   codes belong in neither aliases nor brands. Box branding goes in
   `brands` and becomes a manufacturer-dropdown bucket.
   See [MODEM_YAML_SPEC.md](../../cable_modem_monitor_core/docs/MODEM_YAML_SPEC.md) § Aliases vs Separate Entries.
8. **Consolidate issue resources.** When a HAR is incomplete (e.g.,
   missing XHR due to Playwright `networkidle` bug), extract data from
   screenshots, embedded HTML/JS, and user confirmations before building
   the fixture. Note provenance in `modem.yaml` sources.
9. **Logout is an operational requirement — confirm it works.** Logout prevents
   stale server-side sessions from blocking re-authentication. For every modem
   with `actions.logout` configured, ask the contributor to confirm the endpoint
   responds (any 2xx or redirect) after a successful login. If the logout
   request appeared in the HAR with a Cookie header, set `requires_session: true`;
   if no Cookie header was present, set `requires_session: false` (the default).
10. **Fixture values trace to observed artifacts.** Every value written into a
    golden file or verified.json must come from a real artifact — the
    contributor's diagnostics, a HAR, page source, or a posted screenshot. Never
    invent a value to fill a gap or make a fixture look complete (no plausible
    channel reading, no placeholder uptime, no "typical" SNR). A missing field
    stays null, or the entry isn't confirmed yet (see Diagnostics partial wins).
    A fixture that looks correct but holds a hand-filled value is wrong even when
    the value happens to be right — the next contributor's real data won't match.
