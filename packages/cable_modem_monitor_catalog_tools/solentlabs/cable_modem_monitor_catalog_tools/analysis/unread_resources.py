"""Post-analysis unread-resource reporting.

Lists the HAR's JSON endpoints that the generated config will not read,
each with its key skeleton and value types. It is the LLM's view of what
nothing in the pipeline looked at.

**Why this exists:** gap categories are endpoint-level and cover auth and
actions only. A data endpoint the generator never maps produces no gap
and no warning — intake writes a ``parser.yaml`` that omits it, every
gate stays green, and the page is invisible. Issue #185's HAR carried
``/rest/v1/cablemodem/serviceflows`` at 200 with four registered Tier-2
fields on it, and nothing asked what had never been looked at.

**Keys and types only, never values.** This artifact flows into an LLM
context and often into a GitHub issue. Keys are what make the judgment
possible: an LLM recognizes ``maxTrafficRate`` as a provisioned rate,
where ``856000000`` on its own tells it nothing. Values are where MAC
addresses, serial numbers and boot filenames live — the same #185 HAR
answers ``/rest/v1/system/gateway/provisioning`` with a ``macAddress``
and fills its event log with ``CM-MAC=`` strings.

**Not a gate.** Every HAR has unread endpoints, so a gate here would
fail every intake. This rides alongside ``warnings``: always present,
informational, never failing. Classifying what an endpoint contains and
deciding whether it is worth mapping is the reading LLM's job, not this
module's.

**JSON-RPC:** every call shares one endpoint, so each method is a
resource. ``path`` carries the method name and ``shape`` its result;
the login method is auth's, and a method called twice takes its later
result, as golden generation does. Other JSON a page fetches is still
reported by path; only the shared endpoint is not.
