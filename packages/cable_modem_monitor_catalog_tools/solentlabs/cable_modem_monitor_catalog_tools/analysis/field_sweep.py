"""Field-granularity sweep of a committed catalog entry against its own HAR.

Reads a capture for keys that resolve to a registry field, and reports
the ones the committed entry never extracts.

**How this differs from ``unread_resources``.** That module answers
"which endpoints did nothing read?" — endpoint granularity, no registry
knowledge, run at intake on a HAR that has no committed config yet. It
is blind to an endpoint that *is* read but read incompletely: the
SB8200's ``/cmconnectionstatus.html`` is a parser resource, so it is
never unread, and its "Boot State" row goes unmapped in silence. This
module answers "which registry fields did the capture carry that the
entry does not populate?" — field granularity, registry-aware, run over
the already-committed catalog.

**What counts as extracted** is the committed ``parser.yaml`` plus the
committed golden file. A field can reach the output without a
``field:`` line — ``channel_type: {fixed: qam}``, ``fixed_fields``, the
XML ``lock_status: {all_of: [...]}`` derivation, an ``aggregate:``
total, or a ``parser.py`` post-processor. Reading the golden alongside
the config covers the last of those, which no static read of the YAML
can see.

**Only fields with a canonical home are surfaced.** The vocabulary is
the shipped alias maps — ``field_registry.json`` for channel fields,
``mapping.system_info`` for system_info, ``mapping.service_flows`` for
the provisioned maxima. Serial numbers, MAC addresses, boot filenames,
event logs and MTA lines have no registry field; they are new-schema
questions gated by ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS § Core Schema Model, and
several are PII-adjacent. This module cannot name them and does not try.

**Keys only, never values** — same rule as ``unread_resources``, for
the same reason: the report flows into an LLM context and often into a
GitHub issue, and values are where the identifiers live.

**Union across directions.** A channel key carries no reliable
direction, so a channel field counts as extracted when *either*
``downstream`` or ``upstream`` populates it. A field read downstream
but missed upstream does not surface. Widening that would need a
direction the capture does not carry.
