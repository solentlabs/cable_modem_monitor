***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Connection and Authentication Issues

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Problem: Login Failures and Timeout Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "Failed to log in to modem" error message
- Sensors show "unavailable" or "unknown"
- Logs show timeout or connection errors
- XB7 users may see timeout messages in logs

**Improved Logging (v2.6.0+):**
Starting in v2.6.0, connection issues are logged with appropriate severity levels:
- **Timeouts** - Logged at DEBUG level (modem may be busy or rebooting)
- **Connection errors** - Logged at WARNING level (network issue)
- **Authentication failures** - Logged at ERROR level (wrong credentials)

This reduces log noise while still capturing important diagnostic information.

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 1. Modem Rebooting or Busy

**Symptoms:**
- Intermittent timeout errors
- Sensors occasionally unavailable
- Happens randomly, then recovers

**What's Happening:**
Cable modems periodically reboot or become busy during channel maintenance. This is normal.

**Solution:**
- **No action needed** - Integration will retry on next poll
- Check the Cable Modem Health Status sensor (v2.6.0+) to see modem responsiveness
- If timeouts persist for >10 minutes, check modem power and connections

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 2. Network Issues vs. Web Server Issues

**New in v2.6.0: Dual-Layer Health Monitoring**

The integration now performs both ICMP ping and HTTP checks to diagnose connectivity:

| ICMP Ping | HTTP HEAD | Status | Diagnosis |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Success | ✅ Success | `healthy` | Fully responsive |
| ✅ Success | ❌ Fail | `degraded` | Web server issue |
| ❌ Fail | ✅ Success | `icmp_blocked` | ICMP blocked (firewall) |
| ❌ Fail | ❌ Fail | `unresponsive` | Network down / offline |

**Check Health Status:**
- Look at `sensor.cable_modem_health_status` (v2.6.0+)
- Check `sensor.cable_modem_ping_latency_ms` for network performance
- Check `sensor.cable_modem_http_latency_ms` for web server performance
- Monitor `sensor.cable_modem_availability` for uptime percentage

**What to Do:**
- **Degraded**: Web server crashed, try restarting modem
- **ICMP Blocked**: Firewall blocking ping, check network settings
- **Unresponsive**: Check modem power, cables, and network connection

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 3. Wrong Credentials

**Symptoms:**
- Consistent login failures
- Error message about authentication
- Works from web browser but not from integration

**Solution:**
1. Verify credentials work in web browser
2. Check for special characters (some parsers may need escaping)
3. Update credentials in integration settings:
   - Settings → Devices & Services → Cable Modem Monitor
   - Click Configure → Update credentials

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 4. Incorrect IP Address or Port

**Symptoms:**
- Connection errors every poll
- Never connects successfully
- "Network unreachable" errors

**Solution:**
1. Verify modem IP address:
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.100.1  ***REMOVED*** or your modem IP
   ```
2. Check if HTTP is enabled on modem (some ISPs disable web interface)
3. Try default gateway IP:
   - Windows: `ipconfig | findstr "Default Gateway"`
   - Linux/Mac: `ip route | grep default`

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 5. ISP Disabled Web Interface

**Symptoms:**
- Cannot access modem web interface from ANY device
- Integration always fails to connect
- Modem works for internet but no web UI

**Solution:**
- Some ISPs disable modem web interfaces (Xfinity, Rogers, etc.)
- **No workaround available** - Contact your ISP
- Consider using modem stats from ISP app if available

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Using Health Monitoring to Diagnose Issues

**New in v2.6.0: Diagnostic Sensors**

Three new sensors help diagnose connectivity:

1. **Cable Modem Health Status** (`sensor.cable_modem_health_status`)
   - Shows: `healthy`, `degraded`, `icmp_blocked`, or `unresponsive`
   - Use in automations to alert on modem issues

2. **Cable Modem Ping Latency** (`sensor.cable_modem_ping_latency`)
   - Shows Layer 3 (ICMP) response time in milliseconds
   - Normal: 1-10ms for local network
   - Alert if >100ms consistently

3. **Cable Modem HTTP Latency** (`sensor.cable_modem_http_latency`)
   - Shows Layer 7 (HTTP) response time in milliseconds
   - Normal: 10-50ms for local network
   - Alert if >500ms consistently

**Example Automation:**
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Cable Modem Health Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.cable_modem_health_status
        to: "unresponsive"
        for:
          minutes: 5
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Modem Offline"
          message: "Cable modem is not responding. Check power and connections."
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Modem Model Selection

**New in v3.0.0: Modem Model Selection**

During setup and in settings, you can now select your specific modem model or use auto-detection:

**Auto Detection (Recommended):**
- Select "auto" from the Modem Model dropdown
- Integration will try all available parsers to find the right one
- Successful detection info is shown in notifications
- Detection result is cached for faster subsequent connections

**Manual Selection:**
- Choose your specific modem model if auto-detection doesn't work
- Useful if you know your exact model
- Faster connection since it skips auto-detection
- Required for some modems with unique authentication

**Viewing Auto-Detection Logs:**

When using auto-detection, INFO-level logs show the detection process:

```
INFO [config_flow] Using auto-detection mode (modem_choice=auto, cached_parser=None)
INFO [config_flow] No cached parser, will try all available parsers
INFO [config_flow] Attempting to connect to modem at 192.168.100.1
INFO [modem_scraper] Tier 3: Auto-detection mode - trying all parsers
INFO [modem_scraper] Successfully connected to http://192.168.100.1/MotoSwInfo.asp
INFO [config_flow] Detection successful: {'modem_name': 'Motorola MB7621', 'manufacturer': 'Motorola', ...}
INFO [config_flow] Auto-detection successful: updating modem_choice from 'auto' to 'Motorola MB7621'
```

**How to View These Logs:**

INFO-level messages may not appear in the filtered Home Assistant logs UI. To see them:

1. **Method 1 - Download Raw Logs:**
   - Settings → System → Logs
   - Click "Download full log"
   - Open the downloaded file and search for "auto-detection" or "Detection successful"

2. **Method 2 - View Raw Logs (if available):**
   - Settings → System → Logs
   - Look for "View Raw Logs" link
   - Search for "cable_modem_monitor" and "auto-detection"

3. **Method 3 - SSH/Terminal:**
   ```bash
   docker logs homeassistant 2>&1 | grep -i "auto-detection\|Detection successful"
   ```

**If Auto-Detection Fails:**

If you see errors or auto-detection doesn't find your modem:
1. Check the logs for which parsers were attempted
2. Note any error messages (SSL errors, connection refused, etc.)
3. Try manually selecting your modem model if you know it
4. Open a GitHub issue with the auto-detection logs

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Viewing Detailed Logs

**Normal Logs (INFO level):**
```
XB7: Successfully authenticated and fetched status page
```

**Debug Logs (for troubleshooting):**
```yaml
***REMOVED*** configuration.yaml

    custom_components.cable_modem_monitor: debug
```

**What You'll See in Debug Mode:**
- XB7 login flow details
- Timeout details (without stack traces)
- Connection error details
- Parsing debug information
- Detailed auto-detection attempts (all parsers tried, all URLs attempted)

**After enabling debug logging:**
1. Reload integration
2. Wait for next poll
3. Check logs: Settings → System → Logs
4. Search for "cable_modem_monitor"

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Entity ID Cleanup

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Problem: Old Entity IDs Without `cable_modem_` Prefix

**Symptoms:**
- Entities like `sensor.us_ch_1_power` or `sensor.downstream_ch_1_power` exist
- Cannot delete them through the UI (delete button disabled)
- These are from before v2.0 entity naming standardization

**Why This Happens:**
These entities were created before v2.0's automatic entity ID migration, or were created after migration but with the wrong naming scheme. They're tied to the active config entry, which prevents normal deletion.

**Solution: Rename Entities to Use Correct Prefix**

You can rename them through the UI or use a script for bulk updates.

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Option 1: Manual Rename (1-2 entities)

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Entities**
2. Search for the old entity (e.g., `us_ch_1_power`)
3. Click on it
4. Click the **settings gear icon**
5. Under "Entity ID", change it to include the `cable_modem_` prefix:
   - `sensor.us_ch_1_power` → `sensor.cable_modem_upstream_ch_1_power`
   - `sensor.downstream_ch_1_power` → `sensor.cable_modem_downstream_ch_1_power`
6. Click **Update**
7. **Restart Home Assistant**
8. **Hard refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear cache

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Option 2: Bulk Rename Script (10+ entities)

If you have many entities to rename, use this Python script:

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Stop Home Assistant before running this script!**

```python
***REMOVED***!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Rename cable modem entities to use correct cable_modem_ prefix.
Run this script while Home Assistant is STOPPED.
"""
import json
import sys

***REMOVED*** Define the renames needed (add your specific entities here)
renames = {
    'sensor.us_ch_1_power': 'sensor.cable_modem_upstream_ch_1_power',
    'sensor.us_ch_1_frequency': 'sensor.cable_modem_upstream_ch_1_frequency',
    'sensor.us_ch_2_power': 'sensor.cable_modem_upstream_ch_2_power',
    'sensor.us_ch_2_frequency': 'sensor.cable_modem_upstream_ch_2_frequency',
    ***REMOVED*** Add more as needed...
}

***REMOVED*** Load entity registry
registry_path = '/config/.storage/core.entity_registry'
try:
    with open(registry_path, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"ERROR: Could not find {registry_path}")
    print("Make sure you run this on your Home Assistant server")
    sys.exit(1)

***REMOVED*** Create backup
backup_path = registry_path + '.backup'
with open(backup_path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
print(f"✓ Backup created: {backup_path}")

***REMOVED*** Rename entities
renamed = 0
skipped = 0
for entity in data['data']['entities']:
    old_id = entity.get('entity_id')
    if old_id in renames:
        new_id = renames[old_id]
        ***REMOVED*** Check if new_id already exists
        existing = any(e.get('entity_id') == new_id for e in data['data']['entities'])
        if existing:
            print(f"⊗ Skipping {old_id}: {new_id} already exists")
            skipped += 1
            continue
        entity['entity_id'] = new_id
        print(f"✓ Renamed: {old_id} → {new_id}")
        renamed += 1

print(f"\nTotal renamed: {renamed}")
print(f"Skipped (already exist): {skipped}")

if renamed > 0:
    ***REMOVED*** Save the updated registry
    with open(registry_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
    print(f"\n✓ Changes saved to {registry_path}")
    print("\nNext steps:")
    print("1. Start Home Assistant")
    print("2. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)")
    print("3. Verify entities appear with new names")
else:
    print("\nNo changes made.")
```

**Steps:**

1. **Stop Home Assistant** (Settings → System → Stop)
2. Copy the script to your Home Assistant server
3. Edit the `renames` dictionary with your specific entity IDs
4. Run: `sudo python3 rename_entities.py`
5. **Start Home Assistant**
6. **Hard refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**To restore from backup if needed:**
```bash
sudo cp /config/.storage/core.entity_registry.backup /config/.storage/core.entity_registry
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Upstream Sensors Not Appearing

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Problem: No Upstream Channel Sensors Created

**Symptoms:**
- You see `sensor.cable_modem_upstream_channel_count` showing 4-8 channels
- But individual upstream sensors (`US Ch X Power`, `US Ch X Frequency`) are missing
- Only downstream sensors are created

**Causes:**
1. **Missing Frequency Data** - Some modems don't report upstream frequency (fixed in v2.0.0)
2. **Parser Column Mismatch** - Parser reading from wrong HTML table columns (fixed in v2.0.0)
3. **Validation Too Strict** - Upstream channels rejected due to missing optional data (fixed in v2.0.0)

**Solution:**

1. **Upgrade to v2.0.0 or later** - These issues are fixed
2. **Check logs** for parsing errors:
   - Settings → System → Logs
   - Search for "cable_modem_monitor"
   - Look for "Parsed upstream channel" messages
3. **Enable debug logging** to see detailed parsing:
   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       custom_components.cable_modem_monitor: debug
   ```
4. **Reload the integration**:
   - Settings → Devices & Services → Cable Modem Monitor
   - Click ⋮ (three dots) → Reload

If upstream sensors still don't appear after upgrading to v2.0.0+, please [open an issue](https://github.com/kwschulz/cable_modem_monitor/issues) with:
- Your modem model
- Debug logs showing upstream parsing
- Diagnostics download from the integration

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Duplicate Entities

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Problem: Seeing Same Entity Twice (One Under Device, One Ungrouped)

**Symptoms:**
- Same sensor name appears twice in entity list
- One is under "Cable Modem" device
- One is under "Ungrouped" or orphaned
- Often happens after renaming entities

**Cause:**
Browser cache is showing old entity registry data.

**Solution:**

1. **Hard Refresh Browser**
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

2. **Or Clear Browser Cache**
   - Clear cache for your Home Assistant URL
   - Reload the page

3. **Or Restart Home Assistant**
   - Settings → System → Restart
   - This forces a complete refresh

The "Ungrouped" entity will disappear once the browser cache is cleared.

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Migration Issues

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Problem: Entities Not Migrating from v1.x to v2.0

**Symptoms:**
- After upgrading to v2.0, entities still have old IDs
- No automatic migration occurred
- Entities use old naming without `cable_modem_` prefix

**What Should Happen:**
v2.0 includes automatic entity ID migration that runs on first startup after upgrade.

**If Migration Didn't Work:**

1. **Check if migration ran**:
   - Settings → System → Logs
   - Search for "Migrating" or "entity_id"
   - Look for migration log messages

2. **Manual Migration Options**:
   - See [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) for detailed steps
   - Option 1: Fresh install (cleanest)
   - Option 2: Manual rename (preserves history)

3. **Common Migration Blockers**:
   - **Conflict with another integration** - If another integration already uses the target entity ID, migration will skip that entity
   - **Platform mismatch** - If entity is from a different platform (not `cable_modem_monitor`), it won't migrate
   - **Missing entity registry** - Rare, but entity registry corruption can prevent migration

**Check for Conflicts:**
```yaml
***REMOVED*** Look for log messages like:
"Cannot migrate sensor.downstream_ch_1_power: Target entity ID already exists (platform: other_integration)"
```

**Solution for Conflicts:**
1. Delete or rename the conflicting entity from the other integration
2. Reload Cable Modem Monitor integration
3. Migration will retry automatically

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Quick Reference

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Correct Entity ID Format (v2.0+)

| Sensor Type | Entity ID | Display Name |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Downstream Power | `sensor.cable_modem_downstream_ch_1_power` | DS Ch 1 Power |
| Downstream SNR | `sensor.cable_modem_downstream_ch_1_snr` | DS Ch 1 SNR |
| Upstream Power | `sensor.cable_modem_upstream_ch_1_power` | US Ch 1 Power |
| Upstream Frequency | `sensor.cable_modem_upstream_ch_1_frequency` | US Ch 1 Frequency |
| Channel Count | `sensor.cable_modem_downstream_channel_count` | DS Channel Count |

**Note:**
- Entity IDs always include `cable_modem_` prefix
- Display names use DS/US abbreviations (industry standard)
- DS = Downstream, US = Upstream
