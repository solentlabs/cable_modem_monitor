# Getting Started with Cable Modem Monitor Development

**Choose your development environment and get coding in minutes**

This guide helps you set up your development environment and start contributing to Cable Modem Monitor.

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

### Want the fastest setup?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kwschulz/cable_modem_monitor.git
cd cable_modem_monitor
./scripts/setup.sh    # Installs dependencies in .venv
code .                # Opens in VS Code - that's it!
```

✅ **Use Local Python when:** Writing code, running tests, quick iterations
✅ **You get:** Full IDE features, fastest test execution, native performance
❌ **You don't get:** Isolated environment, guaranteed consistency with CI

### Want zero setup hassles?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kwschulz/cable_modem_monitor.git
cd cable_modem_monitor
code .                # Opens in VS Code
# Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted (wait 2-3 min first time)
```

✅ **Use Dev Container when:** Need exact CI environment, cross-platform team, want isolation
✅ **You get:** Isolated environment, matches CI exactly, all dependencies pre-installed
❌ **You don't get:** Native speed (slightly slower due to Docker overhead)

---

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Do you have dependency or environment issues?
├─ YES → Use Dev Container (guaranteed consistency)
└─ NO  → Is speed critical for your workflow?
         ├─ YES → Use Local Python (fastest)
         └─ NO  → Use Dev Container (safer)
```

**Still unsure?** Start with Local Python - it's simpler and faster. Switch to Dev Container if you hit environment issues.

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Local Python (Fastest)

#### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+** installed on your system
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **Make** (optional, but recommended)

#### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kwschulz/cable_modem_monitor.git
   cd cable_modem_monitor
   ```

2. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh    # Linux/Mac
   # OR
   bash scripts/setup.sh  # Windows (Git Bash)
   ```

   This automatically:
   - Creates Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
   - Installs all dependencies
   - Sets up pre-commit hooks
   - Verifies installation

3. **Open in VS Code:**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

4. **What you'll see:**
   - **Notifications:** "Install recommended extensions?" - Click "Install" (6 essential extensions)
   - **Terminal:** Automatically shows setup instructions if `.venv` is missing
   - **After setup:** Terminal auto-activates `.venv` on next open

5. **Verify everything works:**
   ```bash
   make validate
   ```

**Pros:**
- ⚡ Fastest test execution
- 💾 Minimal disk space (~500MB)
- 🚀 Quick iteration cycle
- 🔧 Works with any editor

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not isolated from system
- ⚠️ Platform-specific issues possible

- **VS Code** with "Dev Containers" extension
  - [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Install extension: `ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`

#### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kwschulz/cable_modem_monitor.git
   cd cable_modem_monitor
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code:**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

3. **Reopen in container:**
   - VS Code will show: "Reopen in Container" → Click it
   - **OR** Press `F1` → Type "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
   - Wait 2-5 minutes for first-time build

4. **Wait for setup to complete:**
   - VS Code builds the container
   - Installs Python dependencies automatically
   - Shows "✅ Dev environment ready!" when complete

5. **Verify everything works:**
   ```bash
   make validate
   ```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Consistent environment across all platforms
- ✅ All dependencies pre-installed
- ✅ Matches CI exactly (fewer surprises)
- ✅ Complete isolation from host system
- ✅ Docker-in-Docker for testing with real Home Assistant
- ✅ Easy to reset and start fresh

**Cons:**

## After Opening in VS Code

### What Notifications to Expect

When you open the project in VS Code, you'll see notifications. Here's what to do:

| Notification | What to Do |
|--------------|-----------|
| **"Dev Container configuration available..."** | **Option A:** Click "Reopen in Container" (no local setup needed)<br>**Option B:** Dismiss and use local Python (run `./scripts/setup.sh` first if you haven't) |
| **"Install recommended extensions?"** | Click **"Install"** - installs 6 essential extensions:<br>• Python language support (Pylance)<br>• Black formatter (auto-format on save)<br>• Ruff linter<br>• YAML support<br>• Remote Containers (if using dev container)<br>• Spell checker |
| **"GitLens" or "CodeQL" notifications** | **Optional** - dismiss if you don't need them<br>(These are not required for development) |

---

## Validation & Testing

No matter which environment you choose, validation works the same way:

### Quick Validation (30 seconds)

Run before every commit to catch issues early:

```bash
make validate
```

This runs:
- Code linting (Ruff)
- Format checking (Black)
- Quick unit tests

### Full CI Validation (2-5 minutes)

Run before creating a pull request:

```bash
make validate-ci
# OR
./scripts/ci-check.sh
```

This runs:
- Code linting
- Format checking
- Type checking (mypy)
- Full test suite

### Using VS Code Tasks

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) → **"Tasks: Run Task"**:

- **🚀 Quick Validation (Pre-commit)** - Fast validation before commit
- **🔍 Full CI Validation** - Complete CI check
- **🧪 Run All Tests** - Full pytest suite
- **🎨 Format Code** - Auto-format with Black
- **🔍 Lint Code** - Check code style with Ruff

## Switching Between Environments

**Good news:** You can switch anytime! Your code and git state are preserved.

### From Local Python to Dev Container

1. Save your work
2. Press `F1` → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
3. Wait for container to start (instant if previously built)
4. Your code is unchanged, now running in container

### From Dev Container to Local Python

1. Press `F1` → "Dev Containers: Reopen Folder Locally"
2. Activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```
3. Your code is unchanged, now running locally

---

## Daily Workflow

### Starting Your Dev Session

**Local Python:**
```bash
cd cable_modem_monitor
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate venv
code .                     # Open in VS Code
```

**Dev Container:**
```bash
cd cable_modem_monitor
code .                     # VS Code will reopen in container automatically
```

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes**

3. **Run tests frequently:**
   ```bash
   make test-quick      # Quick unit tests
   # OR use VS Code Testing panel
   ```

4. **Validate before commit:**
   ```bash
   make validate
   ```

5. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -am "Add my new feature"
   ```

   Pre-commit hooks will automatically:
   - Format code with Black
   - Check code style with Ruff
   - Validate YAML files

6. **Push and create PR:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

## Testing Fresh Developer Experience (Optional)

**Only needed if you want to test the new developer onboarding experience.** Normal development doesn't require this.

### Cross-Platform Python Script (Recommended)

```bash
python scripts/dev/fresh_start.py
```

This script:
- Clears VS Code's workspace cache for this project
- Optionally removes `.venv` to test complete setup
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Detects if running from VS Code terminal

**Or use VS Code task:**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → Tasks: Run Task → **"🔄 Fresh Start (Reset VS Code State)"**

After running, close VS Code and reopen with `code .` to see the fresh developer experience.
