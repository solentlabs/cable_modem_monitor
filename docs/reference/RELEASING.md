# Release Process

This document describes how to create a new release of Cable Modem Monitor.

## Overview

Releases follow a PR-based workflow:

1. **Develop on feature branch** → Run release script (prepares version bump)
2. **Create/update PR** → CI validates, review changes
3. **Merge to main** → Creates clean history
4. **Tag main** → Triggers GitHub release workflow

## Key Rules

- **CI runs on push. Publishing runs on tag push.** Don't skip the tag.
- **Never manually edit version numbers.** Use `scripts/release.py`.
- **Never run `gh release create` manually.** Let CI handle it.
- **Dogfood on local HA** before stable releases (maintainer launches,
  not automated).

## Step-by-Step Release

### 1. Prepare the Release (on feature branch)

Run `scripts/check_owned_deps.py` and batch-update anything shown —
releases shouldn't ship with stale declared deps.

```bash
# Ensure you're on your feature branch with all changes committed
git checkout feature/your-branch
git status  # Should be clean

# Run the release script
.venv/bin/python scripts/release.py 3.14.0
```

The release script will:

- Validate version format and clean working directory
- Run tests and code quality checks (pytest, ruff, black, mypy)
- Verify translations are in sync
- Update version in manifest.json, const.py, pyproject.toml files, and test assertions
- Move `[Unreleased]` to `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` in CHANGELOG.md
- Print changed files and suggested next steps

The script does **not** stage, commit, tag, push, or create releases —
the developer handles all git operations.

### 2. Stage, Commit, and Push

```bash
# Review changed files, stage, and commit
git diff
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 3.14.0"

# Push your feature branch
git push origin feature/your-branch

# Create PR if it doesn't exist, or it will update the existing one
gh pr create --title "feat: v3.14.0 - Your Release Title" --body "..."
# Or update existing PR via GitHub UI
```

### 3. Review and Merge

- Wait for CI to pass
- Review the changes
- Merge the PR (squash or merge commit)

### 4. Tag Main and Push

After the PR is merged:

```bash
# Switch to main and pull the merged changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create the release tag on main
git tag -a v3.14.0 -m "Cable Modem Monitor v3.14.0

Key features:
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- See CHANGELOG.md for details"

# Push the tag (triggers release workflow)
git push origin v3.14.0
```

### 5. Verify Release

The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` which:

- Creates a GitHub Release
- Attaches release notes from the tag message

## Release Tiers

Two tiers ship: beta and stable. Both publish to PyPI and create
GitHub Releases with a zip asset. Beta tags carry the GitHub
`prerelease` flag; stable tags don't. Alpha is a development concept
only — alphas run from a local source clone and never tag.

| Tier   | Tag pattern       | PyPI      | GitHub Release          | HACS visibility                   |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Beta   | `v*.*.*-beta.*`   | Published | Pre-release + zip asset | Manual install via version picker |
| Stable | `v*.*.*` (no `-`) | Published | Release + zip asset     | Default (auto-update offer)       |

Betas install manually via HACS → integration → Redownload → "Need
a different version?" → Release. There is no auto-update path on
betas — by design, each beta is a deliberate per-version install.

**Where tags live:**

- The first beta of a release line (`vX.Y.0-beta.1`) tags from
  `main` — directly after the development branch merges in. This
  keeps `main`'s state in lock-step with the latest published
  release as the new model goes live.
- Subsequent betas (`vX.Y.0-beta.2` onward) tag from a beta-line
  branch off `main` (e.g., `feature/vX.Y.0-beta`). Beta iteration
  doesn't disturb `main`. The branch merges back when the line
  cuts stable.
- Stable (`vX.Y.0`) tags from `main` after the beta-line branch
  merges back.

This keeps `main` either at "latest published release" or "ahead of
latest published release by an in-progress merge," never at
"diverged with no tagged version that matches."

### `hacs.json` configuration

```json
{
  "name": "Cable Modem Monitor",
  "render_readme": true,
  "homeassistant": "2024.12.0",
  "hacs": "2.0.0",
  "zip_release": true,
  "filename": "cable_modem_monitor.zip",
  "hide_default_branch": true
}
```

`zip_release: true` and `hide_default_branch: true` are paired. With
both set, HACS distributes only the zip assets attached to GitHub
Releases and hides the default-branch option from the version
selector entirely. Users can't accidentally try to install from a
branch ref, which would 404 (see "Why branch tracking is unsupported"
below).

### Why branch tracking is unsupported

HACS reads `hacs.json` from the **default branch**, not from the
branch a user is tracking. When `zip_release: true` is set on the
default branch, HACS expects a zip asset on every install path
including branch refs. Branch refs have no GitHub Release object, so
HACS constructs a zip URL that returns 404 — by design, not a bug.

Confirmed by HACS maintainer in
[hacs/integration#3513](https://github.com/hacs/integration/issues/3513)
(closed 2024-02-16):

> *"This is correct. It should not be possible. When a repository
> uses release assets (`zip_release`), only those assets are valid."*
> — ludeeus, HACS maintainer
>
> *"Ask the author if you need a development version. If that was
> possible before, that was a bug."*

`hide_default_branch: true` is the maintainer-recommended companion:
HACS hides the branch dropdown from the version selector entirely so
users don't see the broken path.

For developers who do need to run from a branch (rare — typically
only the maintainer testing an unreleased commit), install outside
HACS: clone the repo, symlink `custom_components/cable_modem_monitor`
into the HA config dir, and `pip install -e` the Core and Catalog
packages.

## Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, backward compatible

## Branching and Merging

### Applying a fix to multiple feature branches: rebase, don't cherry-pick

When the same fix needs to land on multiple in-flight feature branches
(e.g., v3.11.0 and v3.12.0):

1. Commit the fix to the base branch first (e.g., v3.11.0).
2. Rebase the child branch onto the updated parent:
   `git checkout feature/v3.12.0 && git rebase feature/v3.11.0`
3. Force push the rebased branch: `git push --force-with-lease`

Cherry-picking creates duplicate commits with different SHAs; when the
branches eventually merge to main, you get duplicate history or merge
conflicts. The exception is backporting to *unrelated* branches (e.g.,
a hotfix into an older release line) — cherry-pick is fine there.

### Release branches → main: merge commits, not squash

- Preserves release branch history.
- Child branches rebase cleanly without "skipped commit" noise.
- Shows clear release boundaries in `git log`.

### Beta → main merges are contributor-onboarding-driven

Whether to open a beta-to-main merge PR after each beta tag turns
on **contributor-onboarding pressure**, not a blanket "always
merge" rule. The default GitHub view of the repo shows `main`;
contributors landing on the catalog README, contributor docs, or
intake tooling see whatever is on `main`. When the canonical view
is stale relative to current pipeline reality, contributors start
on outdated docs and friction accumulates.

**Merge a given beta to main when:** the beta contains
contributor-facing doc or tool changes that should be visible at
the canonical GitHub URL. Examples:

- Catalog README updates (new confirmed modems, chipset metadata,
  badge changes)
- `cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools/` workflow changes
  (intake/confirmation tooling, MCP tool additions)
- Contributor-onboarding docs (CONTRIBUTING, INTAKE_PIPELINE,
  MODEM_INTAKE_WORKFLOW, AUTHORING guides)
- Dev tooling that contributors use (`make` targets, pre-commit
  hooks, local CI mirror commands)

**Defer the merge when:** the beta is mostly runtime-code changes,
internal refactors, or test/spec updates with no user- or
contributor-facing surface change. The merge can wait until the
next beta with contributor-facing changes, or until stable cut.

**HACS note:** `main` being on a beta version string is acceptable
here. HACS users who haven't opted into the beta channel install
the latest *stable tag*, not the default branch — so a beta version
string on `main` doesn't break stable installs. Beta-channel users
opt in separately. Don't argue against the merge on HACS grounds.

**Original driver:** the v3.14 architecture moved to `main` early
because contributors were starting on the wrong branch — a major
operational headache. With v3.14 on `main`, that acute pressure is
reduced; later beta merges become more situational.

### Small single-feature/fix PRs: squash merge is fine

Creates one clean commit on main.

## Hotfix Releases

For urgent fixes to a released version:

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from the release tag
git checkout -b hotfix/3.14.1 v3.14.0

# Make fixes, commit, then follow normal release process
.venv/bin/python scripts/release.py 3.14.1
# Stage and commit version bump, then push
git push origin hotfix/3.14.1
# Create PR, merge, then tag main
```

## Release Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing (`pytest tests/ -v`)
- [ ] Code quality checks passing (`ruff check`, `black --check`, `mypy`)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with all changes
- [ ] Version numbers consistent (manifest.json, const.py)
- [ ] PR reviewed and merged to main
- [ ] Tag created on main (not feature branch)
- [ ] GitHub Release created automatically
- [ ] Verify HACS picks up new version

## Troubleshooting

### "Tag already exists"

If you accidentally pushed a tag to the wrong branch:

```bash
# Delete remote tag
git push origin --delete v3.14.0

# Delete local tag
git tag -d v3.14.0

# Start fresh from the tagging step
```

### Release workflow didn't trigger

Ensure the tag follows the pattern `v*` (e.g., `v3.14.0`). Check `.github/workflows/release.yml` for the trigger configuration.
