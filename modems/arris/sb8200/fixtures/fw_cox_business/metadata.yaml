# Key differences from Spectrum variant:
# - Requires HTTPS with legacy SSL ciphers (TLS 1.2 max, no forward secrecy)
# - Uses URL-based token auth: /cmconnectionstatus.html?login_<base64(user:pass)>
# - Sets sessionId cookie on login for subsequent requests
# - Landing page sets empty sessionId cookie (edge case fixed in get_cookie_safe)

notes: |
  This variant requires LegacySSLAdapter due to outdated TLS cipher support.
  The modem sets an empty sessionId cookie on the landing page, then a real
  one on successful login. The get_cookie_safe() function filters empty values
  to handle this edge case.
