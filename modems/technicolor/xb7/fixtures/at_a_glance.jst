    Technicolor XB7 - at_a_glance.jst (Post-Login Landing Page)

    PROVENANCE: Generated fixture for mock server testing
    ========================================================
    This is NOT captured from a real device. It was created to allow
    the mock modem server to complete the form auth redirect flow.

    Auth Flow (from Issue #2 - @esand):
    1. Login form POSTs to /check.jst
    2. Success redirects to /at_a_glance.jst (this page)
    3. User navigates to /network_setup.jst for data

    The real at_a_glance.jst page shows a dashboard overview.
    This minimal version just needs to:
    - Return HTTP 200
    - NOT contain a login form (so auth detection knows login succeeded)

    If you have access to a real XB7, please capture the actual page
    and replace this file. See docs/MODEM_REQUEST.md for instructions.
